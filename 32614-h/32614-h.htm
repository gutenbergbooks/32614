<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> &#8220;Diary of a Resurrectionist&#8221; here reprinted is only of a fragmentary
character. It is, however, unique in being an actual record of the doings
of one gang of the resurrection-men in London. Many persons have expressed
a wish that so interesting a document should be published; permission
having been obtained to print the Diary, an endeavour has been made to
gratify this wish. To make the reprint more interesting, and to explain
some of the allusions in the Diary, an account of the resurrection-men in
London, and a short history of the events which preceded the passing of
the Anatomy Act, have been prepared.</p>

<p>The great crimes of Burke and Hare drew especial attention to
body-snatching in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> Edinburgh, and consequently there have been published
ample accounts of the resurrection-men in Scotland.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> For this reason,
Edinburgh has been omitted from the present work.</p>

<p>As to the genuineness of the Diary there can be no doubt. It was presented
to the Royal College of Surgeons of England by the late Sir Thomas
Longmore. In his early days, Sir Thomas was dresser to Bransby Cooper, and
assisted him in writing the <i>Life of Sir Astley Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Lord Abinger, it was decided to introduce an account
of the resurrection-men into the book. The information for this was partly
obtained by Mr. Longmore from personal communication with some of the
resurrection-men, who were then living in London. One of these handed over
portions of a Diary he had kept during his resurrectionist days. This was
preserved for some years at Netley, and was afterwards presented to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
College, as stated above. A few extracts from the Diary were printed in
the <i>Life of Sir Astley Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>The information respecting the resurrection-men is very scattered; the two
most useful works for getting up this subject are the <i>Life of Astley
Cooper</i> before mentioned, and the <i>Report of the Committee on Anatomy</i>
published in 1828. Most of the detailed information has to be sought for
in the newspapers of the period. The accounts there given are, however,
generally of such an exaggerated character that it is often very difficult
to arrive at the truth. When any fresh scandal had given prominence to the
doings of the resurrection-men, the newspapers saw &#8220;Burking&#8221; in every
trivial case of assault. If a child were lost, the paragraph announcing
the fact was headed, &#8220;Another supposed case of Burking.&#8221; Reports of the
most ridiculous character were duly chronicled as facts by the newspapers
of the day. Sometimes over a hundred bodies were supposed to have been
found in some building, and it was expected that several persons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
eminence would be named in the subsequent proceedings. Search in the
papers nearly always fails to find any further mention of the case.</p>

<p>In reading these accounts it must be remembered that &#8220;Burking&#8221; did not
always mean killing a person for the purpose of selling the body, but it
referred to the mode adopted by Burke and Hare in killing their victims,
viz., suffocation. Elizabeth Ross is called a &#8220;Burker,&#8221; and may be found
so described in Haydn&#8217;s <i>Dictionary of Dates</i>. She murdered an old woman
named Catherine Walsh, but in the report of her trial there is no evidence
of her having attempted to sell the body.</p>

<p>The broadside here printed is an excellent example of this exaggeration.
The facts are so circumstantial, that it appears as though there could be
no mistake. Enquiry at Edinburgh, however, shows that no such case
occurred. Mr. A. D. Veitch, of the Justiciary Office, has very kindly made
search, and can find no record of Wilson&#8217;s supposed crimes. Had the
statements in the broadside been true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> there is no doubt that this case
would have been referred to in books on Medical Jurisprudence. Poisoning
by inhalation of arsenic is rare, and Wilson&#8217;s would have been a leading
case. There would also have been great opportunities for studying <i>post
mortem</i> appearances, as it is stated that three bodies were found in
Wilson&#8217;s possession. Search through the chief books on the subject has
failed in finding any reference whatever to this case.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Burking by means of Snuff.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The following Account is of so serious a Nature that no one can be too
cautious how they receive Snuff from Strangers.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It appears that, on Monday se&#8217;nnight, a man, named John Wilson, was
apprehended at Edinburgh on a charge of Burking a number of persons by
introducing arsenic into snuff kept by him. He had long excited the
suspicion of the police of that place, but so deep-laid were his
diabolical schemes that he eluded their vigilance for a considerable time,
until Monday last. When, on the moors, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> that day, between Lauder and
Dalkeith, practising his dreadful trade, it appears that the victim of
Wilson&#8217;s villainy was a poor man travelling over the moor, whom he
accosted, and offered a pinch of snuff. He took it, and it had the desired
effect. The next individual whom he accosted was a labouring-man breaking
stones, who was asked the number of miles to Edinburgh; when answered, he
then offered his snuff-box to the labourer, which was refused, alleging
that he never used any. Wilson urged him again, which excited the man&#8217;s
suspicions, but he took the snuff, and wrapped it up in paper, and carried
it to a chemist at Dalkeith, who analysed it, when it proved to be mixed
with arsenic. The police were then informed of Wilson&#8217;s villainies, who
went in pursuit of him, and after a search of him for several days was at
length apprehended at a place three miles from Edinburgh, driving rapidly
in a vehicle like a hearse, which, on examination, contained three dead
bodies. They were recognised from their dresses to be an elderly man, and
his wife and son, who were seen travelling towards Lauder the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilson was immediately ironed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> conveyed to Edinburgh, and a sheriff&#8217;s
inquest was held on the bodies. After an investigation of nearly two hours
a verdict of Wilful Murder was returned against John Wilson, who was fully
committed to the Calton gaol to take his trial at the ensuing sessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilson is described as a desperate character, and of ferocious
countenance. He is supposed to have been two or three years in this
abominable practice, and to have realised a considerable sum in the course
of that time. His career is now stopped, and that justice and doom which
overtook a Burke and a Hare are his last and only portion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>The difficulty of getting reliable information is increased by the
incomplete nature of most of the newspaper records. In many cases there is
an account of a preliminary examination of some of the men who were
arrested for body-stealing. The report states that they were remanded, but
further search fails to find any subsequent notice of the case. It is
often impossible to fix who the men <ins class="correction" title="original: where">were</ins> who thus got into trouble, as
they nearly always gave false names: unless they were too well-known to
the police who arrested them, they invariably did this.</p>

<h2>THE DIARY OF A RESURRECTIONIST</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> complaint as to the scarcity of bodies for dissection is as old as the
history of anatomy itself. Great respect for the body of the dead has
characterised mankind in nearly all ages; <i>post mortem</i> dissection was
looked upon as a great indignity by the relatives of the deceased, and
every precaution was taken to prevent its occurrence.</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of the present work to attempt a history of
anatomical teaching; as will be pointed out later on, the resurrection-men
did not come into existence until the early part of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the study of medicine and surgery was much hampered at
this date by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> scarcity of opportunities by which the student might get
a practical acquaintance with the anatomy of the human body. A knowledge
of anatomy was insisted upon by the Corporation of Surgeons, as each
student had to produce a certificate of having attended at least two
courses of dissection. It is unnecessary to point out the wisdom of this
condition in the case of men who were to go out into the world as
surgeons, and, consequently, to have the lives of their fellow-men in
their hands. The attendance on the two courses of dissection could be
evaded, and this was frequently done. The Apothecaries&#8217; Hall had no such
restriction, and, consequently, many men went thither and received a
qualification to practise, although they were quite unacquainted with
human anatomy. The work of such &#8217;prentice hands one trembles to think of;
whatever experience these men did gain was obtained after they began to
practise, and so must have been at the expense of their patients, who were
generally those of the poorer class in life.</p>

<p>It was pointed out by Mr. Guthrie, that in the then state of the law a
surgeon might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> punished in one Court for want of skill, and in another
Court the same individual might also be punished for trying to obtain that
skill. Before the Anatomy Committee, in 1828, Sir Astley Cooper narrated
the case of a young man who was rejected at the College of Surgeons on
account of his ignorance of the parts of the body; it was found, on
enquiry, that he was a most diligent student, and that his ignorance arose
entirely from his being unable to procure that which was necessary for
carrying on this part of his education.</p>

<p>When bodies were obtained for dissection it was generally by surreptitious
means; the newly-made grave was too often the source from whence the
supply was obtained. At first there was no direct trade or traffic in
subjects by men who devoted all their efforts to this mode of obtaining a
livelihood. The students supplied their own wants as they arose. Mr. G. S.
Patterson told the Committee that at St. George&#8217;s Hospital the students
had to exhume bodies for their own use.</p>

<p>In the <i>Diary of a Late Physician</i> Samuel Warren has given us a chapter on
this subject, which he calls &#8220;Grave Doings,&#8221; and which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> probably
founded on fact. The object in the expedition here recorded was, however,
rather to obtain a valuable pathological specimen, than to get a body for
dissection. Writers of fiction have made use of body-snatching, and have
given a gruesome turn to their stories by making the body, when uncovered,
turn out to be that of a relation or friend of some one of the party
engaged in the exhumation. Such a tale is recorded in the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i> for April, 1827; there a sailor is pressed into the service of
some students who were anxious to obtain a body. The subject was safely
brought home, and, on being taken from the sack, turned out to be the
sweetheart of the sailor, who had just returned from sea, and, not having
heard of his girl&#8217;s decease, was on his way to greet her after a long
absence from home. Truth and fiction often agree. There is a case on
record of a child who had died of scrofula, and whose body was brought to
St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital by Holliss, a well-known resurrectionist. The body
was at once recognised by one of the students as that of his sister&#8217;s
child; on this being made known to the authorities at the hospital, the
corpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> was immediately buried before any dissection had taken place.</p>

<p>In vols. 1 and 2 of the <i>Medical Times</i> there is a series of articles,
entitled &#8220;The Confessions of Jasper Muddle, Dissecting-room Porter.&#8221; These
papers are signed &#8220;Rocket,&#8221; but were written by Albert Smith.<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> One of
the articles contains an account of a handsome young lady who came to the
dissecting-room late at night, and begged for the body of a murderer
executed the previous day, which was then being injected, ready for
lecture purposes. In the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>, Dickens has given us a good
study of a resurrection-man in the person of Mr. Cruncher. Moir in <i>Mansie
Wauch</i>, Lytton in <i>Lucretia</i>, Mrs. Crowe in <i>Light and Darkness</i>, and Miss
Sergeant in <i>Dr. Endicott&#8217;s Experiment</i>, have also used the body-snatcher
in fiction.</p>

<p>As long as the Barber Surgeons kept to their right of the exclusive
teaching of anatomy, there was small need of bodies for dissection. This
right the Company jealously guarded. On 21st May, 1573, the following
entry occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> in the records, &#8220;Here was John Deane and appoynted to brynge
in his fyne x<sup>li</sup> for havinge an Anathomye in his howse contrary to an
order in that behalf between this and mydsomer next.&#8221;<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small> As late as 1714
this rule was put in force against no less a man than William Cheselden.
The entry in the books of the Company runs as follows, &#8220;At a Court of
Assistants of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, held on the 25th March,
1714. Our Master acquainting the Court that Mr. William Cheselden, a
member of this Company, did frequently procure the Dead bodies of
Malefactors from the place of execution and dissect the same at his own
house, as well during the Company&#8217;s Publick Lectures as at other times
without the leave of the Governors and contrary to the Company&#8217;s By law in
that behalf. By which means it became more difficult for the Beadles to
bring away the Companies Bodies and likewise drew away the members of this
Company and others from the Public Dissections and Lectures at the Hall.
The said Mr. Cheselden was, therefore, called in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> But having submitted
himself to the pleasure of the Court with a promise never to dissect at
the same as the Company had their Lecture at the Hall, nor without leave
of the Governors for the time being, the said Mr. Cheselden was excused
for what had passed with a reproof for the same pronounced by the Master
at the desire of the Court.&#8221;<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>By the Act Henry VIII., xxii., cap. 12, provision was made for the Company
of Barbers and Surgeons to have the bodies of malefactors for the purpose
of dissection. This part of the Act was as follows: &#8220;And further be it
enacted by thauctoritie aforesayd, that the sayd maysters or governours of
the mistery and comminaltie of barbours and surgeons of Lond&#333; &amp; their
successours yerely for ever after their sad discrecions at their free
liberte and pleasure shal and maie have and take without c&otilde;tradiction
foure persons condempned adjudged and put to deathe for feloni by the due
order of the Kynges lawe of thys realme for anatomies with out any further
sute or labour to be made to the kynges highnes his heyres or successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
for the same. And to make incision of the same deade bodies or otherwyse
to order the same after their said discrecions at their pleasure for their
further and better knowlage instruction in sight learnyng &amp; experience in
the sayd scyence or facultie of Surgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;foure bodies&#8221; could not always be obtained without difficulty;
despite the precautions of the Company private anatomy was, to a certain
extent, carried on, and the bodies of malefactors had a market value. The
following entries from the <i>Annals of the Barber Surgeons</i> are
illustrative of this:</p>

<p>&#8220;6th March, 1711.<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> It is ordered that William Cave, one of the Beadles
of this Company, do make Inquiry who the persons were that carryed away
the last body from Tyburne, and that such persons be Indicted for the
same.</p>

<p>&#8220;9th October, 1711. Richard Russell, one of the persons who stands
Indicted for carrying away the last publick body applying himself to this
Court and offering to be evidence against the rest of the persons
concerned It is ordered that the Clerk do apply himself to Her Majesty&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Attorney Generall for a Noli p&#8217;sequi as to the said Russell in order to
make him an evidence upon the s<sup>d</sup> Indictment and particularly ag<sup>st</sup> one
Samuell Waters whom the Court did likewise order to be indicted for the
said fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Often there were riots caused by the Beadles of the Company going to
Tyburn for the bodies of murderers. This rioting was carried to such an
extent that it was found necessary to apply for soldiers to protect the
Beadles.</p>

<p>&#8220;28th May, 1713. Ordered that the Clerk go to the Secretary at War for a
guard in order to gett the next Body [from Tyburn.]&#8221;</p>

<p>The dissection of these bodies was made known by public advertisement. The
following is from the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of January 15th, 1742: &#8220;Notice is
hereby given that there being a publick Body at Barbers and Surgeons Hall,
the Demonstrations of Anatomy and the Operations of Surgery will be at the
Hall this evening and to-morrow at six o&#8217;clock precisely in the
Amphitheatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1752 it was ordered that bodies of murderers executed in London and
Middlesex should be conveyed to the Hall of the Surgeons Company to be
dissected and anatomized, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> any attempt to rescue such bodies was made
felony.</p>

<p>In 1745 the Barbers and Surgeons, who from 1540, until that date, had
formed one Company, separated, and the latter were incorporated under the
title of &#8220;The Masters, Governors, and Commonalty of the Art and Science of
Surgery.&#8221; To the Surgeons naturally fell the duty of dissecting the bodies
of the malefactors handed over for that purpose. The building of the
Surgeons&#8217; Company was in the Old Bailey; there was, therefore, no
difficulty in removing the bodies from Newgate. In 1796 the Company came
to a premature end through an improperly constituted Court having been
held. It was attempted to put matters right by a Bill in Parliament, but
there was so much opposition from those persons who were practising
without the diploma of the Corporation, that the Bill, after passing
safely through the Commons, was thrown out by the Lords. In the following
year attempts were made to come to terms with the opponents of the Bill,
and finally it was agreed to petition for a Charter from the Crown to
establish a Royal College of Surgeons in London. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> negotiations were
successfully carried out in 1800, and the old Corporation having disposed
of their Old Bailey property to the City Authorities, the College took
possession of a house in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields, the site of part of the
present building.</p>

<p>During the debate in the House of Lords on the Bill just mentioned, the
Bishop of Bangor, who had charge of the measure, sent for the Clerk of the
Company, and informed him that a strong opposition was expected to the
Bill, on account of the inconvenience that would arise from the bodies of
murderers being conveyed through the streets from Newgate to Lincoln&#8217;s Inn
Fields. To remedy this a clause was proposed, giving the College
permission to have a place near to Newgate, where the part of the sentence
which related to the dissection of the bodies might be carried out.</p>

<p>That this difficulty of moving the bodies was not a fancied one, the
following extract from &#8220;Alderman Macaulay&#8217;s Diary&#8221; will show: &#8220;Dec. 6,
1796. Francis Dunn and Will. Arnold were yesterday executed for murder and
the first malefactors conveyed to the new Surgeons&#8217; Hall in the Lincoln&#8217;s
Inn Fields.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> They were conveyed in a cart, their heads supported by tea
chests for the public to see: I think contrary to all decency and the laws
of humanity in a country like this. I hope it will not be repeated.&#8221;<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small></p>

<p>Just at this date the Corporation were removing from their old premises to
Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields; the last Court in the Old Bailey was held on October
6th, 1796, and the first at Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields on January 5th, 1797.</p>

<p>In July, 1797, it was reported to the Court that Mr. Chandler, one of
their members, &#8220;had in the most polite and ready manner offered his stable
for the reception of the bodies of the two murderers who were executed
last month.&#8221; The thanks of the Court were voted to Mr. Chandler &#8220;for his
polite attention to the Company upon that occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the Bill had been lost in the Lords, the following resolution was
passed by the Court in November, 1797: &#8220;Resolved that in order to evince
the sincerity of the Court to remove all reasonable objections to the
present situation in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields the Clerk be directed, with
proper assistance, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> look for a temporary dissecting-room at a place in
or near the Old Bailey until a permanent one near the place of execution
can be established.&#8221;</p>

<p>In June, 1800, a warehouse was taken in Castle Street, Cow Cross, West
Smithfield, for eighteen months, as, owing to the labours of taking over
the Hunterian Collection, there had been no time for obtaining a permanent
place. A house in Duke Street, West Smithfield, was afterwards leased for
the purpose, and arrangements were made for Pass, the Beadle, to reside
there. This landed the College in a small expense, as in 1832 the Beadle
was elected Constable of the Ward of Farringdon, and the Council had to
pay a fine of &pound;10 in place of his serving the office. At the expiration of
the lease of the Duke Street house, so great an increase of rent was
demanded that the College gave up the premises, and took a newly-built
house in Hosier Lane, on a lease for twenty-one years. Here the
dissections were carried on until the passing of the Anatomy Act, when the
College had no longer to share with the hangman the duty of carrying out
the sentence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> murderers who were condemned to be hanged and anatomized.</p>

<p>The bodies were not really dissected by the College Authorities; a
sufficient incision was made to satisfy the requirements of the Act, and
the body was then handed over to one of the Teachers of Anatomy. The
following is a copy of an order authorizing the Secretary of the College
to give up a body:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the body of Mary Whittenbach executed this day at the Old
Bailey for murder be delivered (after the necessary dissection by the
College) to Mr. Joseph Henry Green.</p>

<small>&#8220;To Mr. <span class="smcap">Belfour</span>, Secy. to the College.&#8221;</small></p></div>

<p>There is in the Library of the Royal College of Surgeons of England a
series of drawings of the heads of murderers, made by the two Clifts,
father and son, when the bodies were brought to the College for
dissection. These drawings include Bishop and Williams (see p. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>),<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small>
and Bellingham, who was executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> in 1812 for the murder of Mr. Perceval
in the lobby of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Earl Ferrers, who suffered the extreme penalty of the law in 1760 for the
murder of his steward, was taken to Surgeons&#8217; Hall, where an incision was
made in the body; instead of being further dissected it was given over to
the relatives for burial.</p>

<p>At the execution of Bishop and Williams the Sheriffs of London felt that
some means should be taken to show gratitude to Mr. Partridge, and the
other officials of King&#8217;s College, for the way they had brought the
murderers to justice. The following letter was therefore addressed to the
College of Surgeons:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 16em;">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Justice Hall</span>,</span><br /><span style="margin-left: 20em;">&#8220;<i>Dec.</i> 5, 1831.</span></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>To the Governors and Directors of the College of Surgeons.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is our particular desire and we do ask that it may be thought but
a reasonable request that the bodies of the malefactors executed in
the front of Newgate this morning should be sent to King&#8217;s
College&mdash;by the vigilance of whose surgical establishment these
offenders were detected and ultimately brought to justice, we shall
therefore feel obliged by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> your handing over these bodies to the
King&#8217;s College.</p>

</div>

<p>The body of Bishop was given to Mr. Partridge, and that of Williams went
to Mr. Guthrie at the Little Windmill Street School of Anatomy.</p>

<p>The following account of the reception of one of the bodies is by Mr. T.
Madden Stone, for many years an official at the College. It was printed in
a series of articles, entitled &#8220;Echoes from the College of Surgeons.&#8221;<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small></p>

<p>&#8220;The executions generally took place at eight o&#8217;clock on Mondays, and the
&#8216;cut down,&#8217; as it is called, at nine, although there was no cutting at
all, as the rope, with a large knot at the end, was simply passed through
a thick and strong ring, with a screw, which firmly held the rope in its
place, and when all was over, Calcraft, <i>alias</i> &#8216;Jack Ketch,&#8217; would make
his appearance on the scaffold, and by simply turning the screw, the body
would fall down. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>At once it would be placed in one of those large carts
with collapsible sides, only to be seen in the neighbourhood of the Docks,
and then preceded by the City Marshal in his cocked hat, and, in fact, all
his war paint, with Calcraft and his assistant in the cart, the procession
would make its way to 33 Hosier Lane, West Smithfield, in the front
drawing room of which were assembled Sir William Blizard, President of the
Royal College of Surgeons, and members of the Court desirous of being
present, with Messrs. Clift (senior and junior), Belfour, and myself. On
extraordinary occasions visitors were admitted by special favour. The
bodies would then be stripped, and the clothes removed by Calcraft as his
valuable perquisites, which, with the fatal rope, were afterwards
exhibited to the morbidly curious, at so much per head, at some favoured
public-house. It was the duty of the City Marshal to be present to see the
body &#8216;anatomised,&#8217; as the Act of Parliament had it. A crucial incision in
the chest was enough to satisfy the important City functionary above
referred to, and he would soon beat a hasty retreat, on his gaily-decked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
charger, to report the due execution of his duty. These experiments
concluded, the body would be stitched up, and Pearson, an old museum
attendant, would remove it in a light cart to the hospital, to which it
was intended to present it for dissection.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>These bodies of murderers were the only ones which could be legally used
for dissection; it is therefore obvious that the number was quite
insufficient for the wants of the Metropolitan Schools, and the teachers
were thus forced to obtain a supply from other sources.</p>

<p>It was strongly urged, but urged in vain, that the whole difficulty would
disappear if a short Act were passed, doing away with the dissection of
murderers, and enacting that the bodies of all unknown persons who died in
workhouses or hospitals, without friends, should be handed over, under
proper control, to the different teachers of anatomy. That these would be
sufficient was afterwards made clear by the Committee on Anatomy.<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small> In
their Report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> it is stated that the returns obtained from 127 of the
parishes situate in London, Westminster, and Southwark, or their immediate
vicinity, showed that out of 3744 persons who died in the workhouses of
these parishes in the year 1827, 3103 were buried at the parish expense,
and that of these about 1108 were not attended to their graves by any
relations. The number of bodies obtained from this source would have
exceeded those supplied by the resurrection-men, and would have been
adequate for the wants of the London Schools.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the day contain many proposed solutions of the
difficulty. One correspondent gravely suggested that as prostitutes had,
by their bodies during life, been engaged in corrupting mankind, it was
only right that after death those bodies should be handed over to be
dissected for the public good. Another correspondent proposed that all
bodies of suicides should be used for dissection, and that all those
persons who came to their death by duelling, prize-fighting, or
drunkenness, should be handed over to the surgeons for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Dermott, the proprietor of the Gerrard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> Street, or Little Windmill
Street, School of Medicine, proposed a scheme by which a fund was to be
raised by grants from Government, and from the College of Surgeons, and by
voluntary contributions from the nobility and gentry. This fund was to be
invested in the names of &#8220;opulent and respectable men,&#8221; not more than
one-third of whom were to be members of the medical profession. It was
proposed to expend the interest on this fund in paying a sum not exceeding
seven pounds to those persons who were willing to contract for the sale of
their bodies for dissection. Registers were to be kept of all such
persons, and the Committee were to have the power of claiming the body six
hours after death. Mr. Dermott also suggested that all medical men should
leave their own bodies to be used for anatomical teaching. It is hardly
necessary to point out the absurdity of the first part of this scheme; the
Committee, after paying their seven pounds, would have had no control over
the subsequent movements of the persons whose bodies they had thus
purchased, and it was hardly to be expected that friends of the deceased
would send notice to the Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> that the body was ready for them. Both
parts of the scheme would have required an Act of Parliament, as executors
were not bound to give up a corpse, even though instructions had been left
that it was a person&#8217;s wish that his body should be used for anatomical
purposes. Many such bequests have been made, and in some instances the
desire of the testator has been carried into effect. To try to do away
with some of the prejudices against dissection, Jeremy Bentham left his
body for this purpose; the dissection was duly carried out at the Webb
Street School, and at the request of Dr. Southwood Smith, Mr. Grainger
delivered the following oration over the body on June 9th, 1832:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&mdash;In presenting myself before you this day, at the request of
my friend and colleague, Dr. Southwood Smith, I can assure you I do so
strongly impressed with the high importance of the duty I have undertaken,
and the responsibility I have thus assumed. Gentlemen, it is no ordinary
occasion on which we are assembled. We are here collected to carry into
execution the last wishes of one whose mortal career, prolonged far beyond
the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> limits of man&#8217;s existence, has been devoted with almost
unexampled energy and perseverance to the establishment of those great
moral and political truths, on which the happiness and the enlightenment
of the human race are founded. Ill would it become me, however, to dwell
on the genius, the philanthropy, or the integrity of the illustrious
deceased. His eulogium has already been eloquently pronounced by one more
fitted to do justice to such an undertaking than the humble individual who
now addresses you. It would be more suitable to the object of the present
meeting that I should consider in what manner the intentions of the late
Mr. Bentham, regarding the disposition of his remains, can best be carried
into effect. But before I do this, it may be proper to inform some of my
auditors what those intentions were. This great man was an ardent admirer
of the science of medicine, and his penetrating mind was not slow in
perceiving that the safe and successful practice of the healing art
entirely rests on a thorough knowledge of the natural structure and
functions of the human body. He also perceived that there was but one
method of obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> such knowledge, viz., dissection. In proceeding to
inquire how it came to happen that in a country like England, justly proud
of those numerous institutions in which science is so successfully
cultivated, so little encouragement, or more correctly speaking, so much
opposition, was offered to the advancement of so indispensable a branch of
knowledge, Mr. Bentham discovered that this repugnance to dissection
sprang from a feeling strongly implanted in the human breast&mdash;a feeling of
reverence towards the dead. Far be it from me to condemn such a sentiment,
for it has its source in some of the purest principles of our nature. But
if it can be shown that an undue indulgence in this feeling produces
incalculable mischief in society, it becomes the duty of all who are
interested in the happiness of mankind to oppose the progress of such
injurious opinions. Mr. Bentham, impressed with this idea, and thinking it
unjust that the humbler classes of the community should alone be called
upon to sacrifice those feelings which are cherished alike by the rich and
poor, determined to devote his own body to the public good. He knew that
this determination would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> inflict pain on many of his dearest friends. An
example of this character, emanating from a person so talented, so
influential, and so esteemed, is calculated to operate a most beneficial
effect on the public mind, and I cannot refrain from considering the
dissection of the body now before us as an important era in the progress
of anatomy, as it is one of the first that in this country has been
employed for the purposes of science, under the direct sanction of the
individual expressed during his lifetime; he also knew that obstacles
would probably be offered to its fulfilment, but with an indifference to
personal feeling rarely witnessed, he took effectual means to carry his
resolution into effect. And thus, gentlemen, did the last act of this
illustrious man&#8217;s existence accord with that leading principle of his
well-spent life&mdash;the desire to promote the universal happiness and welfare
of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bentham&#8217;s skeleton, clothed in his usual attire, is now in University
College, London.</p>

<p>Messenger Monsey, the eccentric physician to the Chelsea Hospital, was
exceedingly anxious that his body should be examined after death. He
obtained a promise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Mr. Forster, of Union Court, that he would
perform this service for him. So anxious was Monsey for the <i>post mortem</i>
to be carried out, that in May, 1787, he wrote to Cruikshank, the
anatomist, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Mr. Foster (<i>sic</i>) a Surgeon in Union Court, Broad Street, has been
so good as to promise to open my Carcass and see what is the matter
with my Heart, Arteries, Kidnies, &amp;c. He is gone to Norwich and may
not return before I am [dead]. Will you be so good as to let me send
it to you, or if he comes will you like to be present at the
dissection. I am now very ill and hardly see to scrawl this &amp; feel as
if I should live two days, the sooner the better. I am, tho&#8217; unknown
to you</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">&#8220;Your respectfull humble Servant</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Messr. Monsey.</span>&#8221;</span></p></div>

<p>Monsey lived until December 20th, 1788; his wishes were duly carried out
by Mr. Forster, at Guy&#8217;s Hospital, in the presence of the students.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine gentlemen of Dublin signed a document, in which the wish was
expressed that their bodies, instead of being interred, should be devoted
by their surviving friends &#8220;to the more rational, benevolent, and
honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> purpose of explaining the structure, functions and diseases of
the human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Mr. Boys, who died in 1835, wished to be made into &#8220;essential salts&#8221; for
the use of his female friends. In a letter to Dr. Campbell, written four
years before his death, he asks: &#8220;Are you now disposed (without Burking)
to accomplish my wish, when my breath or spirit shall have ceased to
animate my carcase, to perform the operation of vitrifying my bones, and
sublimating the rest, thereby cheating the Devil of his due, according to
the ideas of some devotees among Christians? And, that I may not offend
the delicate olfactory nerves of my female friends with a mass of
putridity, if it be possible, let me rather fill a few little bottles of
essential salts therefrom, and revive their drooping spirits. It may be
irksome to you to superintend the business, but, perhaps, you have
knowledge of some rising genius or geniuses who may be glad of a subject
without paying for it. Let them slash and cut, and divide, as best please
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following account, taken from a newspaper of 1810, shows that
untoward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> events sometimes followed a request of this kind. A journeyman
tailor died at the <i>Black Prince</i>, in Chandos Street, and directed, in his
will, that his body should be opened in the presence of Mr. Wood, the
landlord. This instruction was carried out. The paragraph goes on to say
that the dissection was scarcely concluded &#8220;when the landlord, a stranger
to such exhibitions, was seized with sickness and vomiting; and, on
reaching the bar, was prevailed upon by his wife to take a glass of brandy
and water; in a few minutes he was obliged to be carried to bed, never to
rise again; on Friday last, the third day from the attack, he died in a
state of delirium, not from contagion, or a predisposition to disease, but
solely from the impression made upon his mind by the anatomical
performance, which, he observed, exceeded in horror any thing he had ever
beheld.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not an uncommon thing for persons to try to put into effect part of
Dermott&#8217;s plan, by offering to leave their bodies for anatomical purposes,
on the condition that they were paid a certain sum down. This was
generally only a swindling dodge, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> by which the teachers were not
to be caught, as they could have no hold on the persons whose bodies they
purchased, nor could they compel the friends to give them up after death.
The following letter, preserved amongst Sir Astley Cooper&#8217;s papers, and
now forming part of the Stone Collection at the Royal College of Surgeons
of England, is a specimen:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been informed you are in the habit of purchasing bodys
and allowing the person a sum weekly; knowing a poor woman that is
desirous of doing so, I have taken the liberty of calling to know the
truth.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;">&#8220;I remain, your humble servant.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;"><small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small></span></p></div>

<p>On the back Sir Astley has written, &#8220;The <i>truth</i> is that you deserve to be
hanged for such an unfeeling offer. A. C.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea at the present day has not died out; quite recently a man called
at the College of Surgeons, and offered to sell his body for a cash
payment. It is a fairly common experience of Curators of Pathological
Museums to have similar offers from persons suffering from a rare disease,
or a curious deformity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">As</span> has been stated in the previous chapter, there was no need of the
resurrection-men, so long as the teaching of anatomy was confined to the
Company of Barbers and Surgeons. It has also been pointed out that, as
late as 1714, Cheselden was reprimanded for having anatomical
demonstrations at his private house. Soon after this date, however, began
the establishment of private schools. Mr. Nourse, of St. Bartholomew&#8217;s,
was one of the first to deliver public lectures at his own house. After a
time this probably became inconvenient, as we find his advertisement, in
1739, worded thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">&#8220;ANATOMY.</p>

<p>&#8220;Designing to have no more lectures at my own house, I think it
proper to advertise that I shall begin a Course of Anatomy,
Chirurgical Operations and Bandages on Monday, the 11th of Nov., at
St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Edw. Nourse</span>, Assistant Surgeon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and Lithotomist to the said Hospital.&#8221;</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Percivall Pott, who was apprenticed to Nourse, followed his master&#8217;s
example, and lectured on Surgery. In 1737 we find Dr. Fr. Nicholls
advertising thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, at the House below the Bull Head,
in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields, at five in the evening, will begin a Course
of Anatomy and Physiology, introductory to the study and practice of
Physick in all its branches by Fr. Nicholls, M.D. N.B. A compendium
referring to the several matters, explain&#8217;d in these Lectures, is
sold by John Clarke, under the Royal Exchange, and F. Woodward, at
the Half Moon, within Temple Bar, Booksellers.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The following is the advertisement of C&aelig;sar Hawkins, from a newspaper of
1739:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In Pall Mall Court, in Pall Mall. On Thursday, the 5th of February
next, will begin a Course of Anatomy, with the principal Operations
in Surgery and their suitable Bandages, by C&aelig;sar Hawkins, Surgeon to
St. George&#8217;s Hospital.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Joshua Brookes&#8217; advertisement, in 1814, ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">&#8220;THEATRE OF ANATOMY, BLENHEIM STREET,<br />GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Summer Course of Lectures on Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery,
will be commenced on Monday, the 6th of June, at seven o&#8217;clock in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> morning. By Mr. Brookes.&mdash;Anatomical Converzationes will be held
weekly, when the different Subjects treated of will be discussed
familiarly, and the Students&#8217; views forwarded. To these none but
Pupils can be admitted. Spacious Apartments, thoroughly ventilated,
and replete with every convenience, will be open at five o&#8217;clock in
the morning, for the purposes of Dissecting and Injecting, when Mr.
Brookes attends to direct the Students and demonstrate the various
parts as they appear on Dissection.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inconveniences usually attending Anatomical Investigations, are
counteracted by an antiseptic process. Pupils may be accommodated in
the House. Gentlemen established in Practice, desirous of renewing
their Anatomical Knowledge, may be accommodated with an apartment to
dissect in privately.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A very interesting account of the old Anatomical Schools, by Mr. D&#8217;Arcy
Power, will be found in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, 1895, vol. 2, p.
141. The paper is entitled &#8220;The Rise and Fall of the Private Medical
Schools in London.&#8221; It has been reprinted, with other articles, in a
pamphlet, entitled <i>The Medical Institutions of London</i>.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, as no licence was required for opening an Anatomical
School, there was no limit to their number; there was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> no regular
legal supply of subjects, except the bodies of murderers, executed in
London and the county of Middlesex, which came to the schools through the
College of Surgeons. In Paris a licence had to be obtained before opening
an Anatomical School, and bodies were regularly supplied to the licensed
places.</p>

<p>With the rise and competition of the Medical Schools in London, the
difficulty of getting an adequate number of bodies increased. The absolute
necessity of having a good supply for the use of students, so as to
prevent them from going off to rival schools, caused the teachers to offer
large prices, and thus made it worth while for men to devote themselves
entirely to obtaining bodies for this purpose. At first the trade was
carried on by a very few men, and without any public scandal, but the
inducements mentioned above enticed others into the business; these were
of the lowest class, often professed thieves, and the fights and disputes
of these men, one with the other, in churchyards, often made really more
scandal than the actual stealing of the bodies. It was stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> by the
police in 1828 that the number of persons who, in London, lived regularly
on the profits of exhumation, did not exceed ten; but there were, in
addition to these, about two hundred who were occasionally employed. These
latter individuals were thieves of the lowest grade, and the most
desperate and abandoned class of the community. The men worked generally
in gangs, and would do anything to spoil the success of their opponents in
the business. If a body were bought by one of the teachers from an outside
source, the regular men would sometimes break into the dissecting-room and
cut the body in such a manner as to make it useless for anatomical
purposes. If this could not be done, they would give information to the
police that a stolen body was lying in a certain dissecting-room. Joshua
Brookes, the proprietor of the Blenheim Street, or Great Marlborough
Street, School, was a victim in this way; a body, for which he had paid 16
guineas, was taken away from his school through information of this kind,
and the police officer who carried out the business was, as a reward for
his efforts, presented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> a silver staff, purchased by public
subscription. Brookes seems to have got on very badly with the
resurrection-men; at one time, because he refused five guineas as a
douceur at the beginning of the session, two dead bodies, in a high state
of decomposition, were dropped at night close to his school by the men
whom he had thus offended; one of these bodies was placed at the Poland
Street end of Great Marlborough Street, and the other at the end of
Blenheim Street. Two young ladies stumbled over one of these bodies, and
at once raised such a commotion that, had it not been for the prompt
assistance of Sir Robert Baker and the police, Brookes would have fared
very badly at the hands of the mob which soon collected. The fact of his
house being near to the Marlborough Police Court, on more than one
occasion saved Brookes from the popular fury.</p>

<p>A subject was brought to him one day in a sack, and paid for at once; soon
after it was discovered that the occupant of the sack was alive. This was
not a case of attempted murder; the &#8220;subject&#8221; was a confederate of those
from whom he had been purchased, and had, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> probability, been thus
introduced to the premises for purposes of burglary.</p>

<p>The competition of the schools had risen to such a height in the demand
for bodies, that Brookes stated that for a subject, which would have cost
two guineas in his student days, he had paid as much as sixteen guineas.
Nor was the cost of the body the only expense to the teacher. At the
beginning of each session he was waited upon by the resurrection-men, who
offered to supply him regularly with bodies at a fixed price, on the
condition that a douceur was paid down at once. The teachers were
powerless in the matter, and had either to accede to the offered terms, or
to lose their students through not having a sufficient supply of subjects.
The scarcity of bodies was most keenly felt at the beginning of the
session; the resurrection-men knew that they could command their own
terms, and would not supply any subjects until the teachers had conceded
all their demands. This was felt to be bad for the students, and Dr. James
Somerville, who was assistant to Brodie at the Great Windmill Street
School, in giving evidence before the Committee on Anatomy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> said that
&#8220;the pupils not being able to proceed for a certain time lose their
ardour, and get into habits of idleness.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the session the resurrection-men again waited on the
proprietors of the schools, and demanded &#8220;finishing money.&#8221; In some papers
relating to Sir Astley Cooper, which were referred to in a letter
published in the <i>Medical Times</i>, 1883, vol. 1, p. 343, we read: &#8220;May
10th, 1827, Paid Hollis, Vaughan, and Llewellyn, finishing money, &pound;6 6s.
0d. 1829, June 18th, Paid Murphy, Wildes, &amp; Naples, finishing money &pound;6 6s.
0d.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cost of the bodies in this way to the teachers was more than they
could charge to the students, and the deficiency thus created was made up
by increased fees for the lectures. The expenses, moreover, did not end
here. If one of the resurrection-men was unfortunate enough to get a term
of imprisonment, the teacher had to partly keep the man&#8217;s wife and family
whilst he was serving his sentence. A solatium was also expected on his
release from gaol. Mr. R. D. Grainger spent &pound;50 in this way for one man,
and several guineas in keeping the family of another Resurrectionist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
whilst the latter was in gaol. Sir Astley Cooper is known to have spent
large sums of money for a similar purpose. The following may be cited as
examples: &#8220;January 29th, 1828, Paid Mr. Cock to pay Mr. South half the
expenses of bailing Vaughan from Yarmouth and going down &pound;14 7s. 0d. 1829,
May 6th, Paid Vaughan&#8217;s wife 6s. Paid Vaughan for twenty-six weeks&#8217;
confinement at 10s. per week, &pound;13 0s. 0d.&#8221;</p>

<p>If any independence were shown by the teachers, and the demands of the men
resisted, victory generally fell to the lot of the Resurrectionists. A
teacher, perhaps, would refuse to pay the exorbitant demands, and would
employ other men to obtain bodies for him. These were then watched by the
regular gang, and information to the police was laid against them on every
occasion. The bodies obtained by the irregular men were often taken from
them by those who considered they had a monopoly in the business; these
subjects were then hacked and cut about so as to make them quite useless
for anatomical purposes. So the supply at this particular school would be
very short, and great indignation would arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> amongst the students, who
had paid their fees, and therefore demanded an adequate number of bodies
for dissection. The teacher was thus obliged to give way, and to accede to
the demands of the regular gang.</p>

<p>The teachers formed themselves into an Anatomical Club for their own
protection; by this means it was hoped to regulate the price to be paid
for bodies, by agreement amongst the members of the Club not to give more
than a certain amount. This agreement does not seem, according to Mr.
South, to have been very faithfully kept, and so, with new schools
springing up and giving rise to still greater competition, the teachers
were as much as ever in the hands of the resurrection-men.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that all the bodies which were supplied to the
schools were exhumed. Many of them were stolen or obtained by false
pretences before burial. Glennon, the police officer, who has been before
mentioned in connection with Joshua Brookes, told the Committee that he
had recovered between fifty and a hundred bodies for persons who had had
their houses broken open, and bodies stolen from them whilst in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> the
coffin awaiting burial. The following case, tried at the London Sessions
in 1830, is an example of this:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;LONDON ADJOURNED SESSIONS.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Tuesday.&mdash;Body-Snatching.</span>&mdash;A well-known pilferer of graves, named Clarke,
was tried upon an indictment, charging him with having stolen the body of
a dead child, aged about four years, which had been under the care of a
nurse named Mary Hopkins. The facts which came out in evidence are as
follows: The deceased was the daughter of a woman of the town, residing in
Shire Lane, and had been kept at the nurse&#8217;s lodging, which was in the
same neighbourhood. She died on a Friday, and Clarke, whose ears were
described as &#8216;quick to the toll of the passing bell,&#8217; paid the nurse a
visit the next morning, under pretence of hiring a cellar under the house.
He took occasion to notice the poor woman&#8217;s son; said it was a pity to see
the boy idle, and that he should have immediate employment, and called
again with evidences of still stronger interest in favour of the family.
&#8216;By the way,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I understand you have had a death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> lately.&#8217; &#8216;Yes,
sir,&#8217; said the nurse, &#8216;a poor little girl is departed.&#8217; &#8216;Poor little
dear,&#8217; cried the snatcher, &#8216;I should like to look at the little innocent.&#8217;
He was forthwith led into the front parlour, where the body lay in a
coffin, and observing that its position was favourable to his intention,
he sympathized with the nurse, and said, &#8216;We must all come to this sooner
or later,&#8217; and then he went to get a half-pint of summut to comfort them.
The nurse disposed of a glass, which presently set her in a profound
sleep, and when she awoke the body of the babe was gone. It appeared that
the snatcher, after having quitted the house, as if for good, returned,
and opening the parlour-window hooked out with a stick the corpse of the
child, and went off with it towards a market that is open at all hours,
near Bridgewater Square. However, a police officer, who knew his trade,
laid hands upon him, telling him he was wanted. The snatcher then threw
down the child and took to his heels, but was apprehended and lodged in
the Compter. The nurse proved the identity of the body. Upon her
cross-examination, by Mr. Payne, she stated that the mother had not been
to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> the deceased for four or five days before the death. The Jury
returned a verdict of Guilty, but some of them audibly spoke of
recommending the prisoner to mercy, but made no appendage to that effect.
The Recorder sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for the space of six
calendar months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes these stolen bodies were claimed after payment had been made to
the resurrection-men, but before any dissection had taken place. The
following refers to Guy&#8217;s Hospital: &#8220;Returned to Vestry Clerk of
Newington, by order of the Treasurer, one male and two females, purchased
of Page, &amp;c., on the 25th, who had broken open the dead-house to obtain
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bodies of suicides, and of those who had met with an accidental death,
were frequently stolen whilst they were awaiting the coroner&#8217;s inquest.
Often in these cases the body-thieves, after selling the subject to a
teacher of anatomy, secretly gave information to the police where the
missing body might be found. It was then seized by the police, and, after
the inquest, handed over to those who claimed to be relatives; these
supposed relatives were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> frequently confederates of the thieves, and by
them the body was at once taken off and again sold to another teacher.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>The following case is from a newspaper of 1823:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Suicide and the Body Stolen.</span>&mdash;Tuesday evening last a young woman of
respectable and interesting appearance was observed for some time parading
the banks of the Surrey Canal, Camberwell, in a melancholy mood, and at
length she plunged into the water; on which a man rushed in after her and
dived several times, but failed in recovering the body, which was not
found till the following morning, when it was taken to the Albany Arms,
near the Canal, for the Coroner&#8217;s inquest, which was to have taken place
on Thursday. On the landlord proceeding to the shed on Wednesday morning,
where the body had been deposited, he discovered, that in the course of
the night, it had been broken open, and the corpse of the female stolen
away. He instantly repaired to the Police Office, Union Street, and gave
information of the circumstance to the Magistrates, who gave orders that
immediate inquiry should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>be made at Mr. Brookes&#8217;s, where the body has
since been discovered and given up. The poor woman was unclaimed, and the
verdict of the Coroner&#8217;s Jury was &#8216;Found Drowned.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A favourite trick, in the carrying out of which a woman was generally
necessary, was that of claiming the bodies of friendless persons who died
in workhouses, or similar institutions. Immediately it was found out that
such an one was dead a man and woman, decently clad in mourning, in great
grief, and often in tears, called at the workhouse to take away the body
of their dear departed relative. If the trick proved successful, as it
often did, the body was taken straight off to one of the schools and sold.
The parish authorities, probably, were not over particular about giving up
the body, if the deceased were a stranger, as by this means they saved the
cost of burial.</p>

<p>Subjects, too, were obtained from cheap undertakers, who kept the bodies
of the poor until the time for burial. The coffin was weighted so as to
conceal the fraud, and the mockery of reading the Burial Service over it
was gone through in the presence of the unsuspecting relatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>That some bodies were obtained by murder there can be no doubt. The
exposure caused by the trials of Burke and Hare in Edinburgh, and Bishop
and Williams in London, proves this.</p>

<p>The facts previously stated, however, go very far to exonerate the
anatomists from the false charge (freely made at the time) of their being
privy to these murders. It has been frequently stated that signs of murder
could be easily seen, and that the fact of the body being fresh, and there
being no evidence of its having been interred, ought to have at once
suggested foul play, and to have caused the teacher to communicate with
the police. But it must be remembered that the murders were generally very
artfully contrived by suffocation, so as to leave no outward signs of
ill-treatment. It was also no uncommon thing, for the reasons just given,
to receive at the schools bodies in quite a fresh state, which had
evidently never received sepulture.</p>

<p>An account of the <i>post mortem</i> on the Italian boy, for whose murder
Bishop and Williams were hanged,<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small> has been preserved by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Clarke.<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> The examination of the body was carried out by Mr.
Wetherfield, of Southampton Street. There were also present Mr. Mayo,
Lecturer on Anatomy at King&#8217;s College; Mr. Partridge, his demonstrator;
Mr. Beaman, Parish Surgeon; and his Assistant, Mr. D. Edwards, and Mr.
Clarke. The boy&#8217;s teeth had been removed and sold to a dentist, but beyond
this there were no external marks of violence on any part of the body. The
internal organs were carefully examined, but no trace of injury or poison
could be found. Mr. Mayo, who had a peculiar way of standing very upright
with his hands in his breeches&#8217; pockets, said, with a kind of lisp he had,
&#8220;By Jove! the boy died a nathral death.&#8221; Mr. Partridge and Mr. Beaman,

however, suggested that the spine had not been examined, and after a
consultation it was decided to do this. It was then found that one or more
of the upper cervical vertebr&aelig; were fractured. &#8220;By Jove!&#8221; said Mr. Mayo,
&#8220;this boy was murthered.&#8221; The conviction of Bishop and Williams was due,
in a very great measure, to Mr. Partridge and Mr. Beaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>At the present day it is well-nigh impossible to understand the relations
between men of honour and education, such as the teachers of anatomy were,
and the ruffians who carried on this ghastly trade. It must, however, be
borne in mind that, until the passing of the Anatomy Act in 1832, there
was no provision for supplying the means by which the student might be
taught this necessary part of his professional education; the only way in
which teachers could get material for giving instruction was by dealing
with the resurrection-men.</p>

<p>It would have been quite impossible for the resurrection-men to have
obtained the number of bodies they frequently did, had they not been able
to bribe the custodians of the different burial-grounds. Sometimes they
met with a difficulty in the shape of a keeper newly appointed to replace
one who had been dismissed for being privy to these depredations. In most
instances this was soon overcome; if, at the outset, the custodian could
not be bribed, he could generally be induced to drink, and then, whilst he
was in a state of intoxication, the body which the resurrection-men wished
to obtain could be easily removed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> After this first step there was
generally very little difficulty in the future.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the grave-diggers not only gave information to the
Resurrectionists, but acted as principals themselves. In Benson&#8217;s
<i>Remarkable Trials</i> is recorded the case of John Holmes, Peter Williams,
and Esther Donaldson. Holmes was grave-digger at St. George&#8217;s, Bloomsbury;
Williams was his assistant, and Donaldson was charged as an accomplice.
They were prosecuted before Sir John Hawkins at the Guildhall,
Westminster, in December, 1777, for stealing the body of Mrs. Jane
Sainsbury, who died in the previous October, and was buried in the St.
George&#8217;s burial-ground. Holmes and Williams were sentenced to six months&#8217;
imprisonment, and to be whipped on their bare backs from the end of
Kingsgate Street, Holborn, to Dyot Street, St. Giles. The sentence, says
Benson, was duly carried out amidst crowds of well-satisfied and approving
spectators. The woman Donaldson was acquitted.</p>

<p>The ranks of the resurrection-men were largely recruited from the keepers
of burial-grounds. When these men had lost their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> situations for
connivance at the stealing of bodies, they naturally joined their old
associates, and became part of the regular gang.</p>

<p>The bribery of the custodians will account for the large number of bodies
often obtained in one night. Had there been the slightest vigilance on the
part of the authorities, it would have been absolutely impossible for the
resurrection-men to have spent the time necessary for their work without
detection. The amount of time required for the work depended greatly on
the soil. One man told Bransby Cooper that he had taken two bodies from
separate graves of considerable depth, and had restored the coffins and
the earth to their former positions in an hour and a half. Another man
said that he had completed the exhumation of a body in a quarter of an
hour; but in this instance the grave was extremely shallow, and the earth
loose and without stones. If much gravel had to be dug through, the
resurrection-men had a peculiar way of using their spades, so that the
gravel was thrown out of the grave quite noiselessly.</p>

<p>On Thursday, February 20th, 1812, the Diary tells us that 15 large bodies
and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> small one were obtained from St. Pancras. No doubt this was
simplified by the custom of burying several paupers in one grave. To
obtain these it was necessary to dig all the earth out, so that each
coffin could be dealt with; the men generally worked very soon after a
funeral, and so the earth was much more easily moved than it would have
been if they had been obliged to dig through undisturbed ground. When only
one body was to be had, a small opening was dug down to the head of the
coffin, which was then broken open, and the body was pulled up with a
rope, fastened either round the neck or under the armpits.</p>

<p>In a memoir of Thomas Wakley, the founder of <i>The Lancet</i>,<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small> the
following account of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the resurrection-men is
given: &#8220;In the case of a neat, or not quite new grave, the ingenuity of
the Resurrectionist came into play. Several feet&mdash;fifteen or twenty&mdash;away
from the head or foot of the grave, he would remove a square of turf,
about eighteen or twenty inches in diameter. This he would carefully put
by, and then commence to mine. Most pauper graves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> of the same depth,
and, if the sepulchre was that of a person of importance, the depth of the
grave could be pretty well estimated by the nature of the soil thrown up.
Taking a five-foot grave, the coffin lid would be about four feet from the
surface. A rough slanting tunnel, some five yards long, would, therefore,
have to be constructed, so as to impinge exactly on the coffin head. This
being at last struck (no very simple task), the coffin was lugged up by
hooks to the surface, or, preferably, the end of the coffin was wrenched
off with hooks while still in the shelter of the tunnel, and the scalp or
feet of the corpse secured through the open end, and the body pulled out,
leaving the coffin almost intact and unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;The body once obtained, the narrow shaft was easily filled up and the sod
of turf accurately replaced. The friends of the deceased, seeing that the
earth <i>over</i> his grave was not disturbed, would flatter themselves that
the body had escaped the Resurrectionist; but they seldom noticed the
neatly-placed square of turf, some feet away.&#8221;</p>

<p>A somewhat similar account is given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> the <i>Memorials of John Flint
South</i>.<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small> This method is also referred to by Bransby Cooper,<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small> who
states that it was told him by one &#8220;who fancied he had found out their
secret, but had, no doubt, been deceived by some of them purposely.&#8221;
Bransby Cooper also says that he asked one of the principal
resurrection-men as to the feasibility of this method, and the man showed
him several objections to it, and stated that &#8220;it would never do.&#8221; This
statement was made after the resurrection-days were over, when there could
be no advantage in keeping the true plan secret. It must be remembered
that there were some amateur body-snatchers, and that it was not at all
unlikely that the regular men would tell to them a plan as full of
difficulties as that quoted above. To make the tunnel as described, would
be impossible, and it is somewhat difficult to see how grappling-irons
were fastened to the coffin; a man could hardly get down a tunnel 18 in.
in diameter and 15 feet in length to do this; if he did succeed, his
difficulties in returning must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> been still greater. To pull a body
out of the head or foot of a coffin, as described, is an impossibility. No
allowance is made, either, in digging the tunnel for obstacles, in the
shape of intervening graves or grave-stones. As regards the evidence on
the surface of a grave having been disturbed, it would be greater in one
opened in this manner than if the recently-disturbed earth had been again
dug out. It would be impossible to get back into the tunnel all the earth
dug out in the course of its construction, and this loose earth would at
once attract attention. Generally, bodies were removed before the graves
were finally tidied up, so that it was difficult to notice a fresh
disturbance.</p>

<p>The writer of the Diary was a cemetery-keeper when he first began his
resurrection proceedings; his <i>modus operandi</i>, in some cases, was to take
the body out of the coffin, and place it in a sack, before he began to
fill in the grave. Then, as he gradually threw the earth in, he kept
pulling the sack to the surface, so that when his work of filling in was
completed, he had the sack close to the top of the grave. He had then only
to wait until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> night, when he was able, under cover of the darkness, to
remove the body without fear of detection. When the resurrection-men had
been successful in their night&#8217;s work, they were glad to find a temporary
shelter for the bodies, as near at hand as possible. This was generally an
out-house belonging to one of the schools which they regularly supplied;
the men were permitted to place the bodies there for the night, and to
fetch them away the next day. This explains some of the entries in the
Diary, such as &#8220;Took the whole to &mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; and the next day, &#8220;Removed the
whole from &mdash;&mdash;.&#8221; Before removing any of the bodies, the men would find
out exactly where they were wanted, and so would save much risk of being
arrested with the bodies in their possession.</p>

<p>If the following broadside could be believed, the resurrection-men
sometimes performed a valuable service to those who had been buried&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;MIRACULOUS CIRCUMSTANCE:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Being a full and particular account of John Macintire, who was buried
alive, in Edinburgh, on the 15th day of April, 1824, while in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>trance,
and who was taken up by the resurrection-men, and sold to the doctors to
be dissected, with a full account of the many strange and wonderful things
which he saw and felt while he was in that state, the whole being taken
from his own words.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I had been some time ill of a low and lingering fever. My strength
gradually wasted, and I could see by the doctor that I had nothing to
hope. One day, towards evening, I was seized with strange and
indescribable quiverings. I saw around my bed, innumerable strange faces;
they were bright and visionary, and without bodies. There was light and
solemnity, and I tried to move, but could not; I could recollect, with
perfectness, but the power of motion had departed. I heard the sound of
weeping at my pillow, and the voice of the nurse say, &#8216;He is dead.&#8217; I
cannot describe what I felt at these words. I exerted my utmost power to
stir myself, but I could not move even an eyelid. My father drew his hand
over my face and closed my eyelids. The world was then darkened, but I
could still hear, and feel and suffer. For three days a number of friends
called to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> me. I heard them in low accents speak of what I was, and
more than one touched me with his finger. The coffin was then procured,
and I was laid in it. I felt the coffin lifted and borne away. I heard and
felt it placed in the hearse; it halted, and the coffin was taken out. I
felt myself carried on the shoulders of men; I heard the cords of the
coffin moved. I felt it swing as dependent by them. It was lowered and
rested upon the bottom of the grave. Dreadful was the effort I then made
to exert the power of action, but my whole frame was immovable. The sound
of the rattling mould as it covered me, was far more tremendous than
thunder. This also ceased, and all was silent. This is death, thought I,
and soon the worms will be crawling about my flesh. In the contemplation
of this hideous thought, I heard a low sound in the earth over me, and I
fancied that the worms and reptiles were coming. The sound continued to
grow louder and nearer. Can it be possible, thought I, that my friends
suspect that they have buried me too soon? The hope was truly like
bursting through the gloom of death. The sound ceased. They dragged me out
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> coffin by the head, and carried me swiftly away. When borne to
some distance, I was thrown down like a clod, and by the interchange of
one or two brief sentences, I discovered that I was in the hands of two of
those robbers, who live by plundering the grave, and selling the bodies of
parents, and children, and friends. Being rudely stripped of my shroud, I
was placed naked on a table. In a short time I heard by the bustle in the
room that the doctors and students were assembling. When all was ready the
Demonstrator took his knife, and pierced my bosom. I felt a dreadful
crackling, as it were, throughout my whole frame; a convulsive shudder
instantly followed, and a shriek of horror rose from all present. The ice
of death was broken up; my trance was ended. The utmost exertions were
made to restore me, and in the course of an hour I was in full possession
of all my faculties.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;STEPHENSON, PRINTER, GATESHEAD.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>It was quite necessary for the Committee on Anatomy to adopt some means to
protect the resurrection-men who gave evidence before it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> this was done
by suppressing their names, and using letters of the alphabet to
distinguish the witnesses one from another. Popular feeling was so bitter
against these men that they were often severely handled by the mob.
Sometimes the mob made a mistake, and the innocent suffered for the
guilty. In 1823 a coach containing an empty coffin was being drawn along
the streets of Edinburgh; the people, suspecting that it was intended to
convey a body, taken from some churchyard, seized the coach; it was with
great difficulty that the police rescued the driver from the fury of the
mob. The coach they could not save; it was taken through the streets,
thrown over a mound, and smashed; the people then kindled a fire with the
fragments, and danced round it. It turned out that the coffin was intended
to convey to his house, in Edinburgh, the body of a physician who had died
in the country.</p>

<p>On another occasion two American gentlemen, who were looking at the Abbey
of Linlithgow after nightfall, were mistaken for resurrection-men, and
assaulted by the mob.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses, called &#8220;A. B.,&#8221; but who was probably Ben Crouch
himself, stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> twenty-three in four nights was the greatest number
he had ever obtained. He added, &#8220;When I go to work, I like to get those of
poor people buried from the workhouses, because instead of working for one
subject, you may get three or four. I do not think, during the time I have
been in the habit of working for the schools, I got half a dozen of
wealthier people.&#8221; Another witness, who is called &#8220;C. D.,&#8221; but who was,
without doubt, the writer of the Diary, stated that, &#8220;according to my
book,&#8221; in 1809 and 1810 the number of bodies disposed of in England was
305 adults and 44 small; but the same year 37 were sent to Edinburgh, and
the gang had 18 in hand, which were never used at all. In 1810-11, 312
adults were disposed of in the regular session, and 20 in the summer, in
addition to 47 smalls. In the Report of the Committee in 1828, it was
pointed out that, at that time, there were over 800 students attending the
Schools of Anatomy in London, but of these not more than 500 actually
worked at dissection. The number of subjects annually available for
instruction amounted to between 450 and 500, or rather less than one for
each student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>The average price of an adult body was stated to be &pound;4 4s. 0d. It may be
here explained that a &#8220;small&#8221; was a body under three feet long; these were
sold at so much per inch and were generally classified as &#8220;large small,&#8221;
&#8220;small,&#8221; and &#8220;f&oelig;tus.&#8221; The earnings of the resurrection-men may be
gathered from the above entry. To take the year 1810-11, the receipts for
bodies alone come to 1328 guineas; this is exclusive of &#8220;smalls,&#8221; and
probably also of the teeth, in which these men did a large trade. Teeth,
in those days, were very valuable; the amounts received by some of the men
for teeth only will be dealt with in the chapter containing biographical
notices of some of the principal London resurrection-men. It may be here
mentioned that on one occasion Murphy obtained the entry to a vault
belonging to a meeting-house, on the pretence of selecting a burial-place
for his wife. Whilst in there he managed to slip back some bolts, so that
he could easily gain an entrance at another time; this he did at night,
and got possession of teeth by which he made &pound;60.</p>

<p>From the statements of the teachers it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> most likely that &pound;4 4s. 0d. is
under the average price paid for bodies. It must be remembered, too, that
this amount does not include the retaining-fee paid at the beginning of
the session, nor the &#8220;finishing-money&#8221; which was demanded at its close.
The 1328 guineas spoken of above would be divided amongst six or seven
persons, and this, for men in their position, was a large income. The
biographical notes of the chief workers in this horrible trade will show
that some few of them did save money. Taking them, however, as a whole,
they were a dissolute and ruffianly gang; reference to the Diary proves
their drunken habits, and there is more than one entry to show that they
were often in pecuniary difficulties; so much so that on one occasion they
were obliged to have recourse to Mordecai, the Jew.</p>

<p>It was quite useless for those who had just buried a relative or friend to
depend either upon the custodian of the burial-ground, or upon the watch,
to see that the newly-made grave was not violated. The resurrection-men
often met with a guard, instituted by the friends of the deceased, who
would take it in turns to watch by the grave-side through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> whole
night; these friends were frequently armed, and were not afraid to use
their arms if the resurrection-men gave them an opportunity. As a rule the
body-snatchers made off when they found a guard in the cemetery; it was to
their interest not to create a riot, and if they were strong enough to
drive off the watchers, the latter could soon raise a tumult, whereby the
bodily safety of the thieves would be endangered.</p>

<p>Matters did not always pass off so peaceably, particularly in Ireland, as
the following extract from an Irish newspaper for 1830 shows:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Desperate Engagement with Body-snatchers.</span>&mdash;The remains of the late Edward
Barrett, Esq., having been interred in Glasnevin churchyard on the 27th of
last month (January), persons were appointed to remain in the churchyard
all night, to protect the corpse from &#8216;the sack &#8217;em-up gentlemen,&#8217; and it
seems the precaution was not unnecessary, for, on Saturday night last,
some of the gentry made their appearance, but soon decamped on finding
they were likely to be opposed. Nothing daunted, however, they returned on
Tuesday morning with augmented force, and well armed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>About ten minutes
after two o&#8217;clock three or four of them were observed standing on the wall
of the churchyard, while several others were endeavouring to get on it
also. The party in the churchyard warned them off, and were replied to by
a discharge from fire-arms. This brought on a general engagement; the sack
&#8217;em-up gentlemen fired from behind the churchyard wall, by which they were
defended, while their opponents on the watch fired from behind the
tomb-stones. Upwards of 58 to 60 shots were fired. One of the assailants
was shot&mdash;he was seen to fall; his body was carried off by his companions.
Some of them are supposed to have been severely wounded, as a great
quantity of blood was observed outside the churchyard wall,
notwithstanding the ground was covered with snow. During the firing, which
continued for upwards of a quarter of an hour, the church bell was rung by
one of the watchmen, which, with the discharge from the fire-arms,
collected several of the townspeople and the police to the spot&mdash;several
of the former, notwithstanding the severity of the weather, in nearly a
state of nakedness; but the assailants were by this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>time defeated, and
effected their retreat. Several of the head-stones bear evident marks of
the conflict, being struck with the balls, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the disgraceful riots which took place in the burial-grounds, were
not between resurrection-men and friends guarding a grave, but between two
gangs of body-snatchers. In cases of this kind one gang would do all in
its power to bring its rival into disrepute; the stronger party, after
driving the weaker one away, would put the burial-ground into a most
disgraceful state, and then give information against their opponents.</p>

<p>Besides watching, many other devices were tried to prevent the
depredations of the resurrection-men; spring guns were set in many of the
cemeteries, but these were often rendered harmless. If the men intended
going to a certain grave at night, late in the afternoon a woman, in deep
mourning, would walk round the part of the cemetery in which the grave was
situated, and contrive to detach the wires from the guns. Loose stones
were placed on the walls of the grave-yard, so as to make scaling the
walls almost an impossibility; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> was useless when the custodian had a
house with a window looking into the burial-place. If entrance could not
be obtained in this way, there was generally some other house through
which the men could gain admission to the grave-yard. Mort-safes, or
strong iron guards, were placed over newly-made graves for protection;
some of these can be seen at the present day in the Greyfriars Churchyard,
Edinburgh (see illustrations).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iron coffins were also used by some persons to protect their friends from
the Resurrectionist. The following interesting advertisement appeared in
<i>Wooler&#8217;s British Gazette</i> for October 13th, 1822:</p>

<p>&#8220;Many hundred dead bodies will be dragged from their wooden coffins this
winter, for the anatomical lectures (which have just commenced), the
articulators, and for those who deal in the dead for the supply of the
country practitioner and the Scotch schools. The question of the right to
inter in iron is now decided. Lord Chief Justice Abbott declared he wished
they might be generally used; Justice Bailey declared that if the
Ecclesiastical Court was to grant a suit <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>for a fee, they, the Court of
King&#8217;s Bench, would grant a prohibition, knowing it had no such right. Sir
William Scott, now Lord Stowell, decided and directed the interment
without any extra fee, as this question was raised by an undertaker; those
undertakers who have <span class="smcaplc">IRON COFFINS</span> must divide the profits of the funeral
with <span class="smcap">Edward Lillie Bridgman. Ten Guineas</span> reward will be paid on the
conviction of any Parish Officer demanding an extra fee, whereby I shall
lose the sale of a coffin. The violation of the sanctity of the grave is
said to be needful, for the instruction of the medical pupil, but let each
one about to inter a mother, husband, child, or friend, say shall I devote
this object of my affection to such a purpose; if not, the only safe
coffin is Bridgman&#8217;s <span class="smcaplc">PATENT WROUGHT-IRON ONE</span>, charged the same price as a
wooden one, and is a superior substitute for lead. Edward Lillie Bridgman,
34, Fish Street Hill, and Goswell Street Road, performs funerals in any
part of the kingdom, and by attention to moderate charges insures the
recommendation of those who employ him. Twenty-five private grounds within
the Bills of Mortality receive them; dues <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>from seven shillings to one
guinea. Patent cast-iron tombs and tablets, superior to stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The advertisement is headed by a rough cut, showing the coffin<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small> and the
iron clamps by which it was fastened. There was another maker of patent
coffins, who is mentioned by Southey in his ballad called <i>The Surgeon&#8217;s
Warning</i>. The ballad represents the fear of a dying surgeon, lest his
apprentices should serve him after death as he, during his life, has
served many other persons:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;And my &#8217;prentices will surely come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And carve me bone from bone,</span><br />
And I, who have rifled the dead man&#8217;s grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall never rest in my own.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Bury me in lead when I am dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My brethren, I entreat,</span><br />
And see the coffin weigh&#8217;d I beg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest the plumber should be a cheat.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;And let it be solder&#8217;d closely down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Strong as strong can be, I implore,</span><br />
And put it in a patent coffin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That I may rise no more.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;If they carry me off in the patent coffin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their labour will be in vain,</span><br />
Let the undertaker see it bought of the maker,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who lives in St. Martin&#8217;s Lane.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>All the surgeon&#8217;s wishes were duly carried out as regards his coffin;
money was also given to watchers to keep guard every night over the grave.
The &#8220;&#8217;prentices,&#8221; however, were able easily to buy the watchers, and so</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;They burst the patent coffin first,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then cut through the lead,</span><br />
And they laugh&#8217;d aloud when they saw the shroud,<br />

<br />
&#8220;And they allow&#8217;d the sexton the shroud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And they put the coffin back,</span><br />
And nose and knees they then did squeeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The surgeon in a sack.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="spacer">&#183;</span><span class="spacer">&#183;</span><span class="spacer">&#183;</span><span class="spacer">&#183;</span><span class="spacer">&#183;</span><span class="spacer">&#183;</span></span><br />
&#8220;So they carried the sack pick-a-back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And they carved him bone from bone,</span><br />
But what became of the surgeon&#8217;s soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was never to mortal known.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The following extract from a Scotch paper shows the alarm felt for the
safety of the newly-buried:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Resurrection-men.</span>&mdash;Curiosity drew together a crowd of people on Monday,
at Dundee, to witness the funeral of a child, which was consigned to the
grave in a novel manner. The father, in terror of the resurrection-men,
had caused a small box, inclosing some deathful apparatus, communicating
by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>means of wires, with the four corners, to be fastened on the top of
the coffin. Immediately before it was lowered into the earth, a large
quantity of gunpowder was poured into the box, and the hidden machinery
put into a state of readiness for execution. The common opinion was, that
if any one attempted to raise the body he would be blown up. The sexton
seemed to dread an immediate explosion, for he started back in alarm after
throwing in the first shovelful of earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Friends and relatives often placed objects on the newly-made grave, such
as a flower or an oyster-shell, so that they might be able to tell if the
earth had been disturbed. These objects were generally carefully noted by
the resurrection-men, and were put back in their exact places after the
body had been removed and the grave re-filled.</p>

<p>In some burial-grounds, houses were built in which the bodies could be
kept until they were putrid, and therefore useless to the
resurrection-men. Such a house is still standing in the burial-ground at
Crail.<small><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a rule, the resurrection-men were able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> not only to supply the
London schools from the grave-yards in and around the Metropolis, but also
to send bodies to some of the provincial schools; the Diary shows that
even Edinburgh received some of the proceeds of the work of this London
gang. If, however, from increased vigilance or other causes, the supply of
bodies ran short in London, recourse was had to the provinces. A case
occurred some seventy years ago at Yarmouth. A man died, and was buried in
St. Nicholas Churchyard. Not long after, his wife died also. On the
husband&#8217;s grave being opened, it was discovered that the man&#8217;s body had
been removed; this led to a panic amongst people in Yarmouth who had
recently buried friends in that churchyard. Many graves were opened, and,
in a large number of instances, were found to have been violated. This led
to a regular watch being established over newly-made graves in the
churchyard. It was the custom of the resurrection-men, when they had
bodies to send from the country to London, to forward them so that they
should, in outward appearance, correspond with the class of goods exported
from the place where the bodies had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> been obtained. If the goods usually
came to London in crates, crates were used by the body-snatchers; if
ordinary packing-cases, then the bodies were enclosed in like receptacles.
The proceeds of the exhumations at Yarmouth were probably packed in
barrels, and came through Billingsgate.</p>

<p>In 1826 three casks, labelled &#8220;Bitter Salts,&#8221; were taken down to George&#8217;s
Dock at Liverpool, to be shipped on board the <i>Latona</i>, bound for Leith; a
full description of this transaction was printed as a broadside, of which
the following is a copy:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;RESURRECTIONISTS AT LIVERPOOL.</p>

<p>&#8220;Discovery of 33 Human Bodies, in Casks, about to be shipped from
Liverpool for Edinburgh, on Monday last, October 9, 1826.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday afternoon, a carter took down one of our quays three casks, to
be shipped on board the Carron Company&#8217;s vessel, the <i>Latona</i>, addressed
to &#8216;Mr. G. Ironson, Edinburgh.&#8217; The casks remained on the quay all night,
and this morning, previous to their being put on board, a horrible stench
was experienced by the mate of the <i>Latona</i> and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>other persons, whose duty
it was to ship them. This caused some suspicion that their contents did
not agree with their superscription, which was &#8216;Bitter Salts,&#8217; and which
the shipping note described they contained. The mate communicated his
suspicions to the agent of the Carron Company, and that gentleman very
promptly communicated the circumstances to the police. Socket, a
constable, was sent to the Quay, and he caused the casks to be opened,
when Eleven Dead Bodies were found therein, salted and pickled. The casks
were detained, and George Leech, the cart-man, readily went with the
officer to the cellar whence he carted them, which was situated under the
school of Dr. McGowan, at the back of his house in Hope Street; the cellar
was padlocked, but, by the aid of a crow-bar, Boughey, a police officer,
succeeded in forcing an entrance, and, on searching therein, he found 4
casks, all containing human bodies, salted as the others were, and three
sacks, each containing a dead body. He also found a syringe, of that
description used for injecting <ins class="correction" title="original: how tax">hot wax</ins> into the veins and arteries of the
dead bodies used for anatomization; he also <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>found a variety of
smock-frocks, jackets, and trowsers, which, no doubt, were generally used
by the Resurrectionists to disguise themselves. In this cellar were found
twenty-two dead bodies, pickled and fresh, and in the casks on the quay,
eleven, making in the whole thirty-three. The carter described the persons
who employed him as of very respectable appearance, but he did not know
the names of any of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Information of the above circumstances was speedily communicated to his
Worship, the Mayor, who sent for Dr. McGowan. This gentleman is a reverend
divine, and teacher of languages; he attended the Mayor immediately, and,
in answer to the questions put to him, we understand he said, that he let
his cellar in January last to a person named Henderson, who, he
understood, carried on the oil trade, and that he knew nothing about any
dead bodies being there. George Leech deposed that he plies for hire as a
carter (the cart belongs to his brother); yesterday afternoon, between
three and four o&#8217;clock, a tall, stout man asked him the charge of carting
three casks from Hope Street to George&#8217;s <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Dock passage; he replied, 2s.
They then went to Hope Street, where the witness found two other men
getting the first cask out of a cellar under Dr. McGowan&#8217;s schoolroom, and
witness assisted to get two other casks out of the cellar; the three were
then put into his cart, and the men who employed him gave him a shipping
note, describing the casks as containing &#8216;Bitter Salts,&#8217; and told him to
be careful in laying them down upon the quay, and that they were to be
forwarded to Edinburgh by the <i>Latona</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thomas Wm. Dawes, surgeon, of St. Paul&#8217;s Square, deposed that he had
examined the bodies, by the direction of the Coroner. In one cask he had
found the bodies of two women and one man; in another, two women and two
men; in the third, three men and one woman, and in the other casks and
sacks he found 22 (<i>sic</i>) bodies, viz., nine men, five boys, and three
girls; the bodies were all in a perfect state; those in the casks appeared
to have been dead six or seven days, and three men found in the sacks
appeared to have been dead only three or four days. In each of the casks
was a large quantity of salt. There were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> external marks of violence,
but there was a thread tied round the toes of one of the women, which is
usual for some families to do immediately after death. Witness had no
reason but to believe that they had died in a natural way, and he had no
doubt the bodies had all been disinterred. The Season for Lectures on
Anatomy is about to commence in the capital of Scotland.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police were ordered to be upon the alert to discover the persons who
had been engaged in this transaction, but as yet nothing further has been
ascertained. The bodies, by the direction of the Coroner, were buried this
morning in the parish cemetery, in casks, as they were found.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not yet ascertained whence these bodies have been brought, but it
is supposed that the Liverpool Workhouse Cemetery has been the principal
sufferer. Some of them are so putrid, that it is extremely dangerous to
handle them.</p>

<p class="center">BOAG, PRINTER.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>The statements in this broadside are quite true, and agree with the
account which is to be found in the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> October 13th,
1826. Henderson, who was a Greenock man, and the principal in this
business, escaped, and could not be brought to justice; but a man named
James Donaldson, who was a party to the transaction, was made to pay a
fine of &pound;50, and was sent to Kirkdale Gaol for twelve months.</p>

<p>From Ireland very many bodies were exported, chiefly to Edinburgh; a
better price could be obtained there than in Dublin, and the consequence
was that the Irish schools were often very badly supplied with subjects.
In Dublin there were several ancient burial-grounds, all badly protected;
the poor were all buried in one part, and, as their friends were generally
unable to afford watchers, their bodies fell an easy prey to the
resurrection-men. In January, 1828, the detection of a body about to be
exported caused a tumult in the streets of Dublin, and led to the murder
of a man named Luke Redmond, a porter at the College of Surgeons.<small><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></small> The
body-snatchers in Dublin seem to have done more damage than the men
engaged in a like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> occupation in London; they were not content with taking
the bodies, but, in addition, they broke the tomb-stones, and played
general havoc in the grave-yards.</p>

<p>According to the following cutting from the <i>Universal Spectator and
Weekly Journal</i>, May 20th, 1732 (printed in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5th ser.
i. 65), bodies were sometimes taken for other than dissection purposes.
&#8220;John Loftas, the Grave Digger, committed to prison for robbing of dead
corpse, has confess&#8217;d to the plunder of above fifty, not only of their
coffins and burial cloaths, but of their fat, where bodies afforded any,
which he retail&#8217;d at a high price to certain people, who, it is believed,
will be call&#8217;d upon on account thereof. Since this discovery several
persons have had their friends dug up, who were found quite naked, and
some mangled in so horrible a manner as could scarcely be suppos&#8217;d to be
done by a human creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Southey also refers to this in the poem before quoted, where he makes the
surgeon say in his lamentation,</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;I have made candles of infants&#8217; fat.&#8221;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">It</span> is well-nigh impossible to read of all these misdoings and not to ask
why the Government did not step in and put a stop to them? It was urged by
many that a short Act should be passed, making the violation of a grave a
penal offence, as it was in France. There was a general agreement that
anatomical education was absolutely necessary for medical men, and that
this education was an impossibility without a supply of subjects; yet
there was a great reluctance to interfere by legislation. The Home
Secretary told a deputation that there was no difficulty in drawing up an
effective Bill; the great obstacle was the prejudice of the people against
any Bill; this impediment, he added, had not been trifling.</p>

<p>By no class of men was legislation more earnestly asked for than by the
teachers of anatomy; to them the system then in vogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> was not only
degrading, but it meant absolute ruin.</p>

<p>There was at that time no property in a dead body, and a prosecution for
felony could not take place unless some portion of the grave-clothes or
coffin could be proved to have been stolen with the body. The
resurrection-men were well aware of this fact, and generally took
precaution to keep themselves out of the meshes of the law.</p>

<p>There had been some successful prosecutions like that of Holmes and
Williams before mentioned, but magistrates would not always convict.</p>

<p>In 1788 this question first came before the Court of King&#8217;s Bench in the
case of Rex <i>v.</i> Lynn. The indictment charged the prisoner with entering a
certain burial-ground, and taking a coffin out of the earth, and removing
a body, which he had taken from the coffin, and carrying it away, for the
purpose of dissecting it. For the defence the following passage from Lord
Coke was quoted: &#8220;It is to be observed that in every sepulchre that hath a
monument two things are to be considered, viz., the monument, and the
sepulture or burial of the dead:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> the burial of the cadaver is <i>nullius in
bonis</i>, and belongs to Ecclesiastical cognizance; but as to the monument,
action is given at the common law for defacing thereof.&#8221; The only Act of
Parliament which was said to bear on the subject was that of 1 Jac. I., c.
12, which made it felony to steal bodies for purposes of witchcraft. The
Court, however, held in this case of Rex <i>v.</i> Lynn that to take a body
from a burial-ground was an offence at common law, and <i>contra bonos
mores</i>. In the judgment it was stated that as the defendant might have
committed the crime through ignorance, no person having been before
punished for this offence, the Court only fined him five marks. The
reference here, to no one having been previously punished for a like
offence, refers only to the Superior Courts, as there had been convictions
at the Police Courts and the Old Bailey. Despite this decision of the
Court, prosecutions were very seldom undertaken, although Southwood
Smith<small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small> states that there had been fourteen convictions in England
during the year 1823. In examination before the Committee on Anatomy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
1828, Mr. Twyford, one of the magistrates at Worship Street Police Court,
stated that he had not had more than six cases in as many years.</p>

<p>The following account of proceedings at Hatton Garden Police Court, in
1814, will show the difficulty of getting a conviction. In this case there
seems to have been no one to identify the bodies. It is very improbable
that in a case of this sort the authorities of burial-grounds would come
forward to give evidence, and so confess their own negligence.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;HATTON GARDEN.</p>

<p>&#8220;T. Light, W. Arnot, and &mdash;&mdash; Spelling, were brought up on Wednesday. It
appeared that the prisoners were going up Holborn about half-past four
o&#8217;clock on Tuesday afternoon, with a horse and cart; they were observed by
two officers, who, knowing the prisoners to be resurrection-men, stopped
the horse and cart, and, after a hard contest, succeeded in securing the
prisoners. They then examined the contents of the cart, and found it
contained seven dead bodies of men and women; one of the bodies was
headless, but how it came to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>so remains as yet to be cleared up. They
were packed up in bags and baskets. The prisoners were followed by an
immense crowd to Hatton Garden Office, whence they were committed to
prison, and the bodies deposited in the lock-up house. The cart was hired
at Battle Bridge. Some of the officers were sent to make enquiry at the
different burying-grounds. The Office was crowded with men and women, who
had some of their relatives buried on Sunday last, to see if they could
recognize any of the bodies. They were brought up again on Thursday, and
discharged.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1822 the case of Rex <i>v.</i> Cundick was tried at Kingston Assizes,
<i>coram</i> Graham.<small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small> This was an indictment for misdemeanour. A man named
Edward Lee was executed in the parish of St. Mary, Newington; George
Cundick was employed by the keeper of the gaol to bury the body of Lee,
and for this he was paid. Instead of burying the corpse, he sold it for
dissection, or, in the words of the indictment, he &#8220;for the sake of wicked
lucre and gain did take and carry away the said body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> and did sell and
dispose of the same for the purpose of being dissected, cut in pieces,
mangled, and destroyed, to the great scandal and disgrace of religion,
decency, and morality, in contempt of our Lord the King, and his laws, to
the evil example of all other persons in like cases offending.&#8221; The
evidence showed plainly that Cundick had had possession of the body, and
that he had received the burial fees. On the friends of Lee wishing to see
the corpse, Cundick declared that it was already buried; but several days
after this he clandestinely went through the ceremony of burying a coffin
filled with rubbish. It was also proved that Cundick had been seen to
remove a heavy package from his house at night, and that the body of Lee
had been identified in a dissecting-room. The defence was, in the first
place, that the indictment was bad &#8220;as a perfect anomaly in the history of
criminal pleading.&#8221; In the second place, if the indictment were good, it
was unsupported by evidence. It was argued by counsel that the only
evidence before the Court was that the body was not buried, and that it
was found at a dissecting-room. Without the production of the owner of the
dissecting-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> and the proof that he had bought the body from Cundick,
the jury could not be asked to give a verdict against the defendant. The
Judge, however, over-ruled these objections, and the jury found the
prisoner guilty.</p>

<p>These trials and verdicts made it still more difficult than before to get
subjects for dissection, as even men of the Resurrectionist class
hesitated to run the risk of getting the punishment, which now the
superior Courts had upheld. Those who did run this risk very naturally
expected a price proportionate to the danger, and so the cost of subjects
was still more increased.</p>

<p>But to surgeons, and to teachers of anatomy, by far the most important
trial of all was that of John Davies and others, of Warrington, for
obtaining the body of Jane Fairclough, which had been taken from the
chapel-yard belonging to the Baptists, at High Cliff, Appleton, Cheshire,
in October, 1827. This case was tried at Lancaster Assizes, March 14th,
1828. The defendants were John Davies (a medical student at the Warrington
Dispensary), Edward Hall (a surgeon and apothecary in practice at
Warrington), William Blundell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> (an apprentice to a stationer in the same
town), and Richard Box. Thomas Ashton was also included in the indictment,
but no evidence was offered against him. There were fourteen counts in the
indictment, ten charging the defendants with conspiracy, and four charging
them with unlawfully procuring and receiving the body of Jane Fairclough.
It appears, from the report of the trial, that Davies called on Dr. Moss,
one of the Physicians to the Dispensary, and obtained permission to use a
building in his garden for the purpose of dissecting a subject which he
had purchased. Mr. Hall, on behalf of Davies, paid four guineas to the men
who brought the body to a cellar in Warrington, but he knew nothing more
of the transaction; from the cellar the body was removed to Dr. Moss&#8217;
premises by Blundell and another man, and was received by Davies and a
servant of Dr. Moss. Information of the exhumation seems to have quickly
got about. The funeral was on a Friday; on the Monday following the grave
was undisturbed, but on Tuesday the soil was spread about, and an
examination of the grave showed that the corpse had been removed. The
body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> was identified at Dr. Moss&#8217; house, and was taken away before any
dissection had been performed on it.</p>

<p>In charging the jury, Mr. Baron Hullock said that, as conspiracy was an
offence of serious magnitude, they should be satisfied, before finding a
verdict of guilty on the former part of the indictment, that the conduct
of the defendants was the result of previous concert.... If any of the
defendants were in possession of the body under circumstances which must
have apprized them that it was improperly disinterred, the jury would find
them guilty of the latter part of the charge. The only bodies legally
liable to dissection in this country were those of persons executed for
murder. However necessary it might be, for the purposes of humanity and
science, that these things should be done, yet, as long as the law
remained as it was at present, the disinterment of bodies for dissection
was an offence liable to punishment. The jury found all the defendants not
guilty of the charge of conspiracy, but they pronounced Davies and
Blundell guilty of possession of the body, with knowledge of the illegal
disinterment. The defendants were brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> for judgment in London in
May, 1828. Mr. Justice Bayley, in passing sentence, said that &#8220;there were
degrees of guilt, and in this case the defendants were not the most
criminal parties.&#8221; He sentenced Davies to a fine of &pound;20, and Blundell to a
fine of &pound;5.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in this trial there is no charge against anyone for
violating the grave, or stealing the body. The fines were inflicted on
Davies and Blundell for having the body in their possession, knowing it to
have been disinterred. This decision, therefore, as before stated, was of
the utmost importance to teachers of anatomy, as they were clearly liable
to punishment for all the subjects supplied to them by the
Resurrectionists. The teachers knew well the sources from which the bodies
were obtained, and were only driven to get them in the way they did
through there being no regular supply of subjects from a legitimate
source. The feeling that legislation on this subject was absolutely
necessary, was more keenly felt than ever, and the teachers did all they
could to get a change in the laws. Many pamphlets were issued from the
press, urging this duty upon Parliament; it was pointed out <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>that if a
supply of bodies could be regularly obtained in a legal way, the trade of
the Resurrectionist would at once cease. There were many who doubted this,
but subsequent events proved the statement to be strictly accurate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bbox" style="width: 470px; height: 330px;"><img src="images/i113tmb.jpg" alt="Surgical Operations, or a New method of Obtaining Subjects." /><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was very strongly urged that the Act of Geo. II., which ordered the
bodies of all murderers executed in London and Middlesex to be anatomized
by the Surgeons&#8217; Company, ought to be repealed. No doubt this provision
much increased the dislike of the poor to any regulations by which the
bodies of their friends might be given up for dissection after death. It
was felt that dissection by the Surgeons was part of the sentence passed
on a murderer, and therefore carried with it shame and disgrace. To make
provision by law, therefore, for the dissection of the bodies of any other
class of persons was, not unnaturally, distasteful, in that it partly put
them in the same position as murderers.</p>

<p>The answer to the desire for the repeal of this obnoxious clause was that
nothing must be done to weaken the law; it was stated that to withdraw the
part of the sentence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> related to dissection would rob the punishment
of its prohibitive effect. It is somewhat difficult to understand the
argument; surely if the risk of suffering the extreme penalty of the law
would not keep a man from crime, the extra chance of being dissected after
death could hardly be expected to do so. As Sir Henry Halford said, &#8220;I
certainly think that while that law remains they [the public] will connect
the crime of murder with the practice of dissection; an order to be
dissected, and a permission to be dissected, seem to be too slight a
distinction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another objection to the dissection of murderers came from the teachers.
They stated that when the body of a notorious criminal was lying at either
of the Anatomical Schools, the proprietor was pestered by persons of a
morbid turn of mind for permission to view the body. This difficulty was
also felt by the College of Surgeons, and in consequence a placard was
hung up outside the place where the dissections were made, giving notice
that no person could be admitted, unless accompanied by a member of the
Court of Assistants.</p>

<p>To make dissection less distasteful to the general public, and to show the
advantages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> anatomy, some endeavours were made to explain the structure
of the human body to non-professional persons. In Ireland Sir Philip
Crampton lectured with open doors, and gave demonstrations in anatomy to
poor people. These persons, he tells us, became interested in the subject,
and often brought him bodies for dissection. A newspaper cutting of 1829
shows that this was also tried in London. A surgeon called in the
overseers and churchwardens of St. Clement Danes, and gave a demonstration
on a body, explaining its construction, and the use of the internal
organs. &#8220;By this means,&#8221; says the paragraph, &#8220;he so fully absorbed the
self-interest of his audience as to extinguish the pre-conceived notions
of horror and disgust attached to the idea of a spectacle of this
description. The enlightened governors of the parish assented to the <i>post
mortem</i> examination of the body of every unclaimed pauper, an enquiry into
whose case might appear conducive to the interests of medical science.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been already pointed out that, to try to overcome the repugnance to
dissection, some persons left specific instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> that their bodies
should be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The representations of the teachers were so far successful, that in 1828 a
Select Committee was appointed by the House of Commons &#8220;to enquire into
the manner of obtaining subjects for dissection in the Schools of Anatomy,
and into the state of the law affecting the persons employed in obtaining
and dissecting bodies.&#8221; Amongst those who gave evidence before the
Committee were the principal teachers of anatomy, and three of the
resurrection-men. The tone of the Report was decidedly in sympathy with
the teachers, but it strongly condemned the way in which they were
compelled to obtain bodies for dissection. After showing how badly off
English students were for opportunities of learning anatomy, as compared
with those of foreign countries, and pointing out that those students who
really wished to master their art were compelled to go abroad, the Report
proceeds: &#8220;These disadvantages affecting the teachers are such, that
except in the most frequented schools, attached to the greater hospitals,
few have been able to continue teaching with profit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> some private
teachers have been compelled to give up their schools. To the evils
enumerated it may be added, that it is distressing to men of good
education and character to be compelled to resort, for their means of
teaching, to a constant infraction of the laws of their country, and to be
made dependent, for their professional existence, on the mercenary
caprices of the most abandoned class in the community.&#8221;</p>

<p>In March, 1829, Mr. Warburton obtained leave to introduce into the House
of Commons &#8220;A Bill for preventing the unlawful disinterment of human
bodies, and for regulating Schools of Anatomy.&#8221; In this Bill it was
enacted that persons found guilty of disinterring any human body from any
churchyard, burial-ground or vault, or assisting at any such disinterment,
should be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months for the first
offence, and two years for the second offence. Seven Commissioners were to
be appointed; the majority of these were not to be either physicians,
surgeons, or apothecaries. All unclaimed bodies of persons dying in
workhouses or hospitals, were, seventy-two hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> after death, to be given
over for purposes of dissection; but if within this specified time a
relative appeared and requested that the body might not be used for
anatomical purposes, such request was to be granted. Another proposed
change in the law was that a person might legally bequeath his body for
dissection; in such cases the executors, administrators, or next-of-kin
had the option of carrying out the wishes of the testator, or declining to
do so, as they thought fit. A heavy penalty was laid on persons who were
found carrying on human anatomy in an unlicensed building, and it was made
an offence to move a body from one place to another, without a licence for
so doing. All bodies used for dissection were to be buried; the penalty
for failing to do this was fifty pounds.</p>

<p>One great blot on this Bill was the neglecting to repeal the clause which
ordered the bodies of murderers to be given up for dissection. As pointed
out on page <a href="#Page_87">87</a>, this was one of the great reasons which made dissection so
hateful to the poor. During the debate, a motion was made by Sir R. Inglis
&#8220;to repeal so much of the Act 9 Geo. IV. cap. 31, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> empowers judges to
order the bodies of murderers to be given over for dissection.&#8221; This,
however, was lost, eight members only voting for the amendment, and forty
against.</p>

<p>There was strong opposition to the Bill outside the House. Some of the
private teachers were very uneasy as regarded the effect of the Bill on
themselves. The measure spoke of &#8220;recognized teachers&#8221; and &#8220;hospital
schools,&#8221; and all those who were to be entitled to the benefits of the Act
were to have licences from one of the Medical Corporations. The
proprietors of the smaller schools felt that this would result in their
extinction, and that the teaching would all pass to the large schools. In
the country, too, there was strong opposition to the Bill, as
practitioners there felt that they were excluded from any benefit. The
<i>Lancet</i>, always ready in those days with a nickname, dubbed the measure
&#8220;A Bill for Preventing Country Surgeons from Studying Anatomy.&#8221; The
College of Surgeons also petitioned against the Bill. The Council felt
that the appointment of Commissioners, who were to have complete control
over all schools and places of dissection, would greatly interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> with
the privileges of the College. It was pointed out to the House of Commons
that the establishment of a Board, such as that proposed by the Bill, was
virtually placing the whole profession of surgery under the control of
Commissioners, not one of whom need be a member of the profession, and the
majority of whom must not be so.</p>

<p>Another fault of the Bill was that it did not apply to Ireland. A large
supply of bodies was regularly sent from that country to England and
Scotland, and it was felt that to exclude Ireland from the provisions of
the Bill, was simply increasing the temptation for bodies to be still more
largely exported therefrom.</p>

<p>It was also argued that the Bill would tell hardly against the poor, as
they would refuse to go into workhouses or hospitals if they thought that
their bodies would be dissected after death. For this objection there was
no foundation, and Mr. Peel pointed out, in the debate on the third
reading, that &#8220;it was the poor who would really be benefited by the
measure. The rich could always command good advice, whilst the poor had a
strong interest in the general extension of anatomical science.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>The Bill passed the Commons, but was lost in the Lords.</p>

<p>In 1830, Lord Calthorpe was to have again introduced the Bill into the
Upper House, but the intention was abandoned on account of the threatened
dissolution of Parliament. As the <i>Lancet</i> expressed it, &#8220;Dissolution has
so many horrors, that a discussion on the <i>subject</i> at the present time
would be by no means agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Public feeling was now very strong in favour of some law to prevent the
wholesale spoliation of graves, which was going on practically unchecked.
But, as has happened frequently in legislation, the absolute necessity for
a change in the law was brought within the range of practical politics by
a crime of a most diabolical character, one which, in this country,
created a sensation equal to that raised in Scotland by the atrocities of
Burke and Hare in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>On November 5th, 1831, two men, named Bishop and May, called at the
dissecting-room at King&#8217;s College, and asked Hill, the porter, if he
&#8220;wanted anything.&#8221; On being interrogated as to what they had to dispose
of, May replied, &#8220;A boy of fourteen.&#8221; For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> body they asked 12
guineas, but ultimately agreed to bring it in for 9 guineas. They went
off, and returned in the afternoon with another man named Williams,
<i>alias</i> Head, and a porter named Shields, the latter of whom carried the
body in a hamper. The appearance of the subject excited Hill&#8217;s suspicion
of foul play, and he at once communicated with Mr. Partridge, the
Demonstrator of Anatomy. A further examination of the body by Mr.
Partridge confirmed the porter&#8217;s suspicions.<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small> To delay the men, so that
the police might be communicated with, Mr. Partridge produced a &pound;50 note,
and said that he could not pay until he had changed it. Soon after, the
police officers appeared upon the scene, and the men were given into
custody. At the coroner&#8217;s inquest a verdict of &#8220;Wilful murder against some
person or persons unknown&#8221; was brought in, the jury adding that there was
strong suspicion against Bishop and Williams. The prisoners were not
allowed to go free, but were kept in custody. Bishop, Williams, and May
were tried at the Old Bailey, December, 1831. The evidence given against
them showed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> they had tried to sell the body at Guy&#8217;s Hospital; being
refused there, they tried Mr. Grainger, at his Anatomical Theatre, but
with no success. Then they tried King&#8217;s, where their crime was detected.
The body was proved to be that of an Italian boy, named Carlo Ferrari, who
obtained his living by showing white mice. The boy&#8217;s teeth had been
extracted, and it was proved that they had been sold by one of the
prisoners to Mr. Mills, a dentist, for twelve shillings. The jury found
all three prisoners guilty, and they were sentenced to death.</p>

<p>From the subsequent confessions of Bishop and Williams, it was shown that
they had enticed the boy to their dwelling in Nova Scotia Gardens; there
they drugged him with opium, and then let his body into a well, where they
kept it until he was suffocated. To the last the prisoners declared that
the deceased was not the Italian boy, but a lad from Lincolnshire. They
seem to have had great difficulty in disposing of the body, as Bishop, in
his confession, said that, before taking it to Guy&#8217;s, they had tried Mr.
Tuson and Mr. Carpue, both in vain. Bishop and Williams confessed, also,
to the murder of a woman named Fanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> Pigburn, and a boy, whose name was
supposed to be Cunningham. Both of these bodies they sold for dissection.
May was respited, and was sentenced to transportation for life. On hearing
of his respite, May went into a fit, and for some time his life was
despaired of; he, however, partially recovered, but his feeble state of
health was aggravated by the annoyance he received from the other convicts
on board the hulks. He died on board the <i>Grampus</i> in 1832.</p>

<p>May can hardly be described as even a minor poet, if the following verse,
written whilst in prison, may be taken as a fair sample of his
compositions:</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;James May is doomed to die,<br />
And is condemned most innocently;<br />
The God above, He knows the same,<br />
And will send a mitigation for his pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the execution of Bishop and Williams, there was a scene of the most
tremendous excitement. By some mistake, three chains hung from the
gallows; one was taken away as soon as the error was noticed, and this was
recognized by the crowd as a sign that May had been reprieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>The <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> sold upwards of 50,000 copies of the number which
contained the confessions of the murderers. Many persons were injured in
the crowd, and the <i>Dispatch</i> states that those who were hurt were
attended to &#8220;by Mr. Birkett, the dresser to Mr. Vincent, who had been in
attendance [at St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital] to receive any accident that
might be brought in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bishop was the son of a carrier between London and Highgate, and on the
death of his father he succeeded to the business. This he soon sold, and
became an informer. He got mixed up with some of the resurrection-men, and
then regularly took to the occupation. Williams, <i>alias</i> Head, was
Bishop&#8217;s brother-in-law, and was a well-known member of the
resurrection-gang.</p>

<p>In the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> for December 11th, 1831, the following curious
information respecting Williams appeared:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;EXCISE COURT.&mdash;YESTERDAY.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The King</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Head</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Williams, the Murderer</span>.&mdash;The Court was
occupied during a great part of the morning in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>hearing the evidence in
the case of Head, <i>alias</i> Williams (who was hung with Bishop) for carrying
on an illicit trade in the manufacture of glass. It appeared that the
deceased was a <i>Cribb Man</i>, or regular porter, to private glass blowers.
There were found on the premises at No. 2, Nova Scotia Gardens (the scene
of the late murders), a regular furnace, and all the necessary apparatus
for the manufacture of glass, which trade it appears was carried on to a
very considerable extent on the premises. Alexander M&#8217;Knight, an officer
of Excise, deposed that on the 6th of August last, he went to No. 2, Nova
Scotia Gardens, and made a seizure of 68 cwt. of manufactured glass, 24
cwt. of cullet, and 16 cwt. of iron, articles used in the manufacture of
glass. In about half-an-hour afterwards he saw Williams come out of
Bishop&#8217;s yard; Williams spoke to witness, and called him by an opprobrious
name for having made the seizure. Judgment &#8216;abated,&#8217; the goods to be
returned to the Excise Office to be condemned.&#8221;</p>

<p>May had been brought up as a butcher, but this trade he gave up, and
became possessed of a horse and cart with which he was supposed to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ply
for hire. The real business of the vehicle, however, seems to have been to
convey bodies from place to place for the Resurrectionists. Shields, the
porter to the gang, had been watchman and grave-digger at the Roman
Catholic Chapel in Moorfields, so that he was most useful to the other
Resurrectionists in giving information, and in granting facilities for the
removal of bodies. No evidence was offered against him in connection with
the murder of the Italian boy. Soon after the trial he attempted to get
work as a porter in Covent Garden Market, but on his being recognized by
those working there, a shout of &#8220;Burker!&#8221; was raised, and Shields narrowly
escaped with his life, and took refuge in the Police Office.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bbox" style="width: 500px; height: 315px;"><img src="images/i129.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">JOHN HEAD, <i>alias</i> THOMAS WILLIAMS.<span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span>JOHN BISHOP.<br />
Executed December 5, 1831. From Drawings by <span class="smcap">W. H. Clift</span>, made directly after the execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This one incident as regards Shields gives an idea of the public feeling
towards the resurrection-men, and that feeling was quite as bitter towards
the anatomists. It was therefore absolutely necessary that some determined
steps should be taken as regards legislation.</p>

<p>In December, 1831, Mr. Warburton again introduced a Bill into the House of
Commons; it passed safely through both Houses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> became law on August
1st, 1832. By this new Act the Secretary of State for the Home Department
in Great Britain, and the Chief Secretary in Ireland, were empowered to
grant licences for anatomical purposes to any person lawfully qualified to
practise medicine, to any professor or teacher of anatomy, and to students
attending any school of medicine, on an application signed by two justices
of the peace, who could certify that the applicant intended to carry on
the practice of anatomy. It was enacted that executors, or other persons
having lawful possession of a body (provided they were not undertakers, or
persons to whom the body had been handed over for purposes of interment),
might give it up for dissection unless the deceased had expressed a wish
during his life that his body should not be so used, or unless a known
relative objected to the body being given up. If a person had expressed a
wish to be dissected, this wish was to be carried out unless the relatives
raised any objection. No body might be moved for anatomical purposes until
forty-eight hours after death, nor until the expiration of a twenty-four
hours&#8217; notice to the Inspector of Anatomy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> a proper death certificate had
also to be signed by the medical attendant before the body could be moved.
Provision was made for the decent removal of all bodies, and for their
burial in consecrated ground, or in some public burial-ground in use for
persons of that religious persuasion to which the person, whose body was
so removed, belonged. A certificate of the interment was to be sent to the
Inspector within six weeks after the day on which the body was received.
No licensed person was to be liable to any prosecution, penalty,
forfeiture, or punishment for having a body in his possession for
anatomical purposes according to the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important clause was that which did away with the
dissection of the bodies of murderers. This was done by Section XVI.,
which ran as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;And whereas an Act was passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of His late
Majesty, for consolidating and amending the Statutes in England relative
to Offences against the Person, by which latter Act it is enacted, that
the Body of every Person convicted of Murder shall, after Execution,
either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> be dissected or hung in Chains, as to the Court which tried the
Offender shall deem meet; and that the Sentence to be pronounced by the
Court shall express that the Body of the Offender shall be dissected or
hung in Chains, whichever of the Two the Court shall order. Be it enacted,
That so much of the said last-recited Act as authorizes the Court, if it
shall see fit, to direct that the Body of a Person convicted of Murder
shall after Execution, be dissected, be and the same is hereby repealed:
and that in every case of Conviction of any Prisoner for Murder, the Court
before which such Prisoner shall have been tried shall direct such
Prisoner either to be hung in Chains or buried within the Precincts of the
Prison in which such Prisoner shall have been confined after conviction,
as to such Court shall deem meet; and that the sentence to be pronounced
by the Court shall express that the body of such Prisoner shall be hung in
Chains, or buried within the Precincts of the Prison, whichever of the two
the Court shall order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three Inspectors were appointed to carry out the provisions of the Act.
The first Inspectors were Dr. J. C. Somerville, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> England; Dr. Craigie,
of Edinburgh, for Scotland; and Sir James Murray, of Dublin, for Ireland.
There was no provision for punishing persons found violating graves; it
had been already decided that this was an offence at common law; and
presumably the framers of the Act had, at last, sufficient faith in their
measure to believe that it would put an end to the proceedings of the
resurrection-men. If that were so, they were not disappointed. After the
passing of the Act the resurrection-man, as such, drops out of history;
his occupation was gone, and one of the most nefarious trades that the
world has ever seen came completely to an end. Public feeling against
these men did not all at once subside; this strongly militated against
their getting employment, and some of them moved to other quarters, where
they lived under assumed names.</p>

<p>In looking back it is impossible not to regret that Parliament was so slow
to believe that legislation in the direction of the Anatomy Act would do
away with the evils of the resurrection-men. This fact was urged upon them
by the teachers; but popular feeling was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> dead against the anatomists,
who were thought to be responsible for even the worst crimes of the
resurrection-men, that Parliament seemed to fear to do anything which
favoured the teachers, although the great disadvantages under which they
suffered were thoroughly well known. Perhaps the best tribute to the
success of the Act, is the very small alterations which have been made in
it between 1832 and the present day.</p>

<p>A glance at the regulations in force in foreign countries for the supply
of bodies, at the time of the passing of the Anatomy Act, shows that when
a fair provision was made by law for the supply of bodies, the
resurrection-men were unknown. The great advantages of the student on the
Continent, as compared with his brethren in England, were thus pointed out
to the Committee by Mr. [afterwards Sir] William Lawrence: &#8220;I see many
medical persons from France, Germany, and Italy, and have found, from my
intercourse with them, that anatomy is much more successfully cultivated
in those countries than in England; at the same time I know, from their
numerous valuable publications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> on anatomy, that they are far before us in
this science; we have no original standard works at all worthy of the
present state of knowledge.&#8221; It was also shown that this fact was chiefly
the result of the greater opportunities for getting subjects abroad, and
that teachers found that those English students who had been to foreign
schools were the best informed.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Before the Revolution in France the hospitals of Paris were supported by
voluntary contributions, and each had separate funds and Boards of
Management, similar to the hospitals in London at the present day. At the
Revolution these Boards were consolidated, and one administrative body was
formed. This &#8220;Administration des H&ocirc;pitaux, Hospices et Secours &agrave; Domicile
de Paris,&#8221; carried into effect the law passed by the Legislative Assembly,
that the bodies of all those persons who died in hospitals, which were
unclaimed within twenty-four hours after death, should be given up for
anatomical purposes. The distribution from the hospitals to the medical
schools was systematically carried out, generally at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> By Art. 360
of the Penal Code, the punishment for violation of a place of sepulture
was imprisonment for a term varying from three months to a year, and a
fine of from 60 to 200 francs. The result of these regulations was that
exhumation for anatomical purposes was quite unknown.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>In Germany the bodies of persons who died in prisons, or penitentiaries,
and those of suicides, were given up for dissection, unless the friends of
the deceased cared to pay a certain sum to the funds of the school; in
this case the body was handed over to the friends. Other sources of supply
were the bodies of those persons who died without leaving sufficient to
pay the cost of burial, poor people who had been supported at the public
cost, all persons executed, and public women. Although these regulations
were not rigorously carried out, there was an ample supply of bodies for
anatomical purposes, and the resurrection-men were unknown.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>In Austria, if the medical attendant thought necessary, a <i>post mortem</i>
was made on all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> patients who died in hospital, but only unclaimed bodies
were used for dissection; these were given up to the teachers forty-eight
hours after death. In Vienna the supply came from the General Hospital;
this was sufficient for all purposes, and there was no recourse to
exhumation.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>The supply in Italy came from a source similar to that of the other
countries named. The rule was that all bodies of persons who died in
hospital were given up for dissection if required; but, by paying the cost
of the funeral, friends could, if they wished, take away the body. This,
however, was seldom done. There was generally a sufficient supply of
bodies; but, if this ran short, the subjects were obtained from &#8220;the
deposit&#8221; of poor people who died and were buried at the public cost. In
every parish church in Italy there was a chamber in which all the dead
bodies of the poor were deposited during the day-time, after the religious
ceremonies had been performed over them in the church; at night these
bodies were removed either to the dissecting-room or to the burial-fields,
outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> the town. Body-snatching was quite unknown.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>There was an ample supply of bodies in Portugal from similar sources.
Mortality was very high amongst infants, who were put into <i>roda</i>, or
foundling cradles; the bodies of these children could be obtained without
any difficulty. In Portugal the resurrection-man did not exist.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>In Holland there was no lack of material for teaching anatomy, and for
students to learn operative surgery on the dead body. The Dissecting
School at Leyden was supplied from the civil hospitals at Amsterdam. There
was no prejudice against dissection in Holland; in all the principal towns
lectures on anatomy were publicly given, and dissected subjects were
exhibited. Here, again, exhumation was not necessary, and was unknown.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>In the United States the laws relating to anatomy varied very considerably
in the different States; there was no regular supply for the schools, and,
consequently, subjects had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> to be obtained by the aid of resurrection-men.
In Philadelphia and Baltimore, the two great Medical Schools of the United
States in those days, the supply of bodies was obtained almost entirely
from the &#8220;Potter&#8217;s Field,&#8221; the burial-place of the poorest classes. This
exhumation was carried on by an understanding with the authorities that
the men employed by the schools in this work should not be interfered
with. Dissection in the United States was, as in this country, looked upon
with great aversion; this was, no doubt, mainly owing to the fact that the
bodies used for this purpose were obtained from the graves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The</span> Diary of a Resurrectionist is written on 16 leaves, but is,
unfortunately, imperfect. The first entry is November 28th, 1811, and the
last December 5th, 1812. There are no entries in May, June, and July;
during these months there would be little demand for subjects, as the
sessions of the Anatomical Schools ran from October to May. Besides this,
the light nights would interfere with the work of the men. The entry under
the date February 25th refers to this: &#8220;the moon at the full, could not
go.&#8221; The state of the moon was of great importance to these men in their
work; the writer of the Diary has on one of the pages copied out the
&#8220;Rules for finding the moon on any given day,&#8221; and has set out the epact
for 1812 and 1813.</p>

<p>There is no clue in the Diary itself as to the name of the writer, and,
unfortunately, Sir Thomas Longmore<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small> was quite unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> remember the
name of the individual from whom he received it. Feeling was very strong
against the men who had been engaged in the resurrection business, and
therefore, when information was required from them, every effort was made
to keep their names secret. As late as 1843, when the <i>Life of Sir Astley
Cooper</i> was published, the name of this man was carefully concealed,
though most of the other members of the gang were freely spoken of under
their full names. Bransby Cooper<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small> quotes a written statement made by
this man to the effect that he was in Maidstone Gaol in October, 1813.
Enquiry at the gaol has, however, failed to find any mention of him; the
original document is not forthcoming, and it is very probable that there
is a mistake as regards the date. In this statement he is called Josh.
N&mdash;&mdash;, and Bransby Cooper speaks of him as N. There is a letter on
&#8220;Body-snatchers&#8221; in the <i>Medical Times</i>, 1883, vol. i. p. 343, signed,
&#8220;Your Old Correspondent&#8221;; the writer of the letter was, in all
probability, Mr. T. Madden Stone, who had been a correspondent of the
journal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> question from the time of its foundation. Mr. Stone had a
valuable collection of papers and autographs, and his letter is really a
reprint of a paper in his possession relating to payments made to the
resurrection-men. In it occurs the following passage: &#8220;N.B., Sir Astley
Cooper great friend to Naples.&#8221; Mr. Stone presented a large number of
papers and letters to the Royal College of Surgeons, but this particular
one is not in the collection. It is curious that Bransby Cooper makes no
special mention of Naples in his book, although he gives an account of all
the other men with whom Sir Astley had any dealings. He gives a long
notice of &#8220;N.,&#8221; and mentions that he wrote the Diary from which quotations
are made; this is the document now under consideration.</p>

<p>The witness &#8220;C. D.,&#8221; who was examined before the Committee on Anatomy in
1828, was, in all probability, Naples; he gave statistics to show the
number of bodies obtained, and stated that the figures were taken &#8220;from my
book.&#8221; The letters &#8220;C. D.&#8221; are not given as initials; the three
resurrection-men who gave evidence were distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
as &#8220;A. B.,&#8221; &#8220;C. D.,&#8221; and &#8220;F. G.&#8221; The testimony was probably given on the condition that no
names were revealed, and, therefore, definite information cannot be
obtained as to &#8220;C. D.&#8217;s&#8221; real name from the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On one page of the Diary is written &#8220;Miss Naples.&#8221; This does not prove
much, as the names of several other females are mentioned; not, however,
in any connection with the business. The entries look as though the writer
had amused himself by scribbling them down, and then crossing them out
again. &#8220;Miss Naples&#8221; is the only one not crossed through.</p>

<p>It is known that the man described as N&mdash;&mdash; by Bransby Cooper was on board
the <i>Excellent</i> in the action off Cape St. Vincent. In the muster-book of
the <i>Excellent</i> for 1797 Josh. Naples is down as an A.B.: he is there
stated to have been born at Deptford, and to have been 21 years of age in
1795. This seems conclusively to prove that Naples was the man who wrote
the Diary.</p>

<p>The men who composed the gang at the time the Diary was written are, in
that document, nearly always spoken of by their Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> names. Their
names are Ben [Crouch], Bill [Harnett], Jack [Harnett], Daniel,<small><a name="f24.1" id="f24.1" href="#f24">[24]</a></small>
Butler, Tom [Light], and Holliss. This gang, whose doings are recorded in
the Diary, was the chief one in the Metropolis in the early part of the
present century. The account, therefore, of the proceedings of these men
gives a good idea of the work of the body-snatchers in general. Honour
amongst thieves was not the motto of the resurrection-men; they seem to
have been ever ready to sell or cheat their comrades, if a favourable
opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>For the accompanying biographical notes of the men mentioned in the Diary
the writer is indebted chiefly to the account given of them by Bransby
Cooper.<small><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></small></p>

<p>Ben Crouch, the leader of the gang, was the son of a carpenter, who worked
at Guy&#8217;s Hospital. He was a tall, powerful, athletic man, with coarse
features, marked with the small-pox, and was well known as a
prize-fighter. He used to dress in very good clothes, and wore a profusion
of gold rings, and had a large bunch of seals dangling at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> his fob. He was
tried for stealing cloth from Watling Street, but was able to successfully
prove an <i>alibi</i>. Bransby Cooper states that Crouch was seldom drunk, but
when he was in that state he was most abusive and domineering; the Diary
shows him in more than one of these attacks. He was sharp enough to be
always sober on settling-up nights, and so had a distinct advantage over
his comrades; by this means he generally managed to get more than his
proper share of the proceeds of their horrible work. About 1817 he gave up
the resurrection business, and occupied himself chiefly in dealing in
teeth; in this he was joined by Jack Harnett. They obtained licences as
sutlers, so that they might be allowed as camp-followers, both in France
and Spain. A large supply of teeth was thus obtained by them, their plan
being to draw the sound teeth of as many dead men as possible on the night
after a battle. They did not limit their attention to teeth, but made
large sums of money by stealing valuables from the persons of those who
had fallen in battle&mdash;proceedings which were even more brutal than their
former resurrectionist practices. With the money he had thus made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> Crouch
built a large hotel at Margate, which at first looked like being a paying
concern. The nature of his former occupation, however, leaked out, and
ruined his business; he then parted with the property at a great
sacrifice. Subsequently he became very poor, and, whilst Harnett was away
in France, Crouch appropriated some of his property; for this he was
sentenced to twelve months&#8217; imprisonment. After this he lived in London,
in great poverty, and was ultimately found dead in the top room of a
public-house near Tower Hill. It is very probable that at one time he made
money by lending to the medical students. In his &#8220;Confessions of a
Dissecting-room Porter,&#8221; before alluded to, Albert Smith says, &#8220;I beg you
will look at your watches, if you have not already lent them to Uncle
Crouch.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Bill Harnett was a favourite with Astley Cooper and Henry Cline. With the
exception of a fondness for gin, he seems to have been a more respectable
man than one would have expected to find in such company. He was very
obliging, and could generally be trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> to carry out his promises.
Bransby Cooper states that Bill Harnett and &#8220;N.&#8221; objected to Crouch, and
often worked against him; in the Diary they will be all found working
together, though there is recorded at least one &#8220;row&#8221; with Crouch. Bill
Harnett was a good boxer, and fought Ben Crouch at Wimbledon; he had
previously received an injury to his jaw, and Crouch hit him a severe blow
on this part, which decided the fight in Crouch&#8217;s favour. Harnett died in
St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital of consumption. Like Southey&#8217;s &#8220;Surgeon,&#8221; he had a
great horror of being dissected, and on his death-bed he obtained a
promise from Mr. Joseph Henry Green that his body should not be opened.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Jack Harnett was a nephew of Bill; he is described as a stout, red-haired,
ill-looking fellow, uncouth in his address and manner of speech. Like his
partner, Crouch, he seems to have been fond of display in the matter of
jewellery. But, unlike Crouch, he did not lose the money he had made, and
at his death left nearly &pound;6,000 to his family.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Butler was originally a porter in the dissecting-room at St. Thomas&#8217;.
Bransby Cooper describes him as &#8220;a short, stout, good-tempered man, with a
laughing eye and Sancho-Panza sort of expression.&#8221; He was a clever
articulator, and dealt largely in bones and teeth. Afterwards he set up as
a dentist in Liverpool; but his dissolute habits were his ruin, and he was
obliged to fly from his creditors. Butler was sentenced to death for
robbing the Edinburgh mail, but his execution was postponed. During this
delay he obtained the skeleton of a horse, and articulated it in the
prison. The Austrian Archdukes John and Lewis were at that time in this
kingdom, and, on visiting the prison in Edinburgh, were shown this
skeleton; they were so pleased with the man&#8217;s handiwork that they obtained
his pardon from the Prince Regent. After his release, Butler was never
heard of again by any of his old comrades or employers.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Tom Light is not mentioned by Bransby Cooper by name; he gives an account
of a resurrection-man whom he calls &#8220;L&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; but whether this notice
refers to Light or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> cannot be definitely determined. In all
probability L&mdash;&mdash; and Light are identical; Cooper speaks of the former as
being so unreliable that his comrades could never trust him. Tom Light
seems to have had a happy knack of escaping justice; on p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a> will be
found an account of his being acquitted, even when taken with the bodies
in his possession. He does not seem to have worked regularly with Crouch&#8217;s
gang; at Hatton Garden Police Court he appeared as T. Light, <i>alias</i> John
Jones, <i>alias</i> Thomas Knight, in October, 1812, and it was stated against
him that he had lately been convicted at the Middlesex Sessions of
stealing dead bodies for dissection, but he had evaded standing his trial,
in consequence of which the Bench issued a warrant against him. The
particular charge on which he was now brought before the magistrates was
that, with Patrick Harnell,<small><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></small> one of his bail, he had been found in the
act of stealing three dead bodies from the parish burial-ground of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Pancras, or St. Giles, which were separated only by a wall. The men were
apprehended by the horse patrol of the Hampstead and Highgate district.
There was some difficulty in carrying on the case, as, until it was
determined from which burial-ground the bodies had been taken, it could
not be said which parish was the real prosecutor. Light attempted to
escape, but was secured. The newspaper adds, &#8220;and, from the frequency of
such offences, strong indignation was excited in the neighbourhood, from
whence a crowd attended at the office.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Holliss was originally a sexton, and, like so many of his class, came into
the pay of the Resurrectionists; at last his demands became so exorbitant
that the resurrection-men refused to pay him, and informed his employers
of what had been taking place. He was at once dismissed, and, having no
other means of livelihood, he joined the resurrection-men. He saved money,
and afterwards purchased a hackney coach, which he himself drove. Like
most of his companions, Holliss came to a bad end. Harnett, the younger,
had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> to France, and had brought away with him a large number of
teeth, which he valued at &pound;700; these he entrusted to his daughter, who
left them in a hackney carriage. The driver found the teeth, and, not
knowing how to dispose of them, consulted his friend, Holliss. Holliss
offered &pound;5 for the teeth, and promised an extra sum if they sold well.
Harnett had made known his loss to Holliss, so that he knew perfectly well
to whom the teeth belonged. Thinking that he could make more money by
selling them privately than by trusting to a reward from Harnett, he began
to dispose of the teeth to dentists. Harnett made enquiries of some of his
customers as to whether they had lately been offered teeth for sale, and
was shown some lately purchased from Holliss; these he was able to
identify. Holliss was at once given into custody, and was tried at
Croydon; he escaped transportation through a flaw in the indictment.
Whilst he was in gaol awaiting his trial, Harnett seized Holliss&#8217; house
and all his household furniture for a debt of &pound;83. Holliss was afterwards
mixed up in a horse-stealing case, and ultimately died in great poverty
and wretchedness.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&#8220;N.&#8221; or Joseph Naples, the writer of the Diary, is described by Bransby
Cooper as &#8220;a civil and well conducted man, slight in person, with a
pleasing expression of countenance, and of respectful manners.&#8221; He was the
son of a respectable stationer and bookbinder, and in early life went as a
sailor into the King&#8217;s service. He was for some time on board the
<i>Excellent</i>, and served in that vessel in the engagement off Cape St.
Vincent.<small><a name="f27.1" id="f27.1" href="#f27">[27]</a></small> Then he returned to England, and, having spent all his
prize-money, went on a vessel cruising about the Channel. From this he ran
away and came back to London; here he obtained a situation as grave-digger
to the Spa Fields burial-ground. A man named White enticed Naples into the
resurrectionist business; this soon caused him to lose his situation.
White was stopped by the patrols, and a body was found in his possession.
He managed to escape, but it was proved that the body had been taken from
Spa Fields, and Naples was sentenced to two years&#8217; imprisonment. He
escaped, with another prisoner, from the House of Correction by making an
opening through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> a skylight in the roof, and afterwards scaling the outer
walls of the prison by means of a rope.</p>

<p>He was retaken through information given against him by Crouch, and it was
only by the mediation of Sir Astley Cooper with the Secretary of State
that Naples escaped additional punishment. In the list of prisoners
written out by himself, and printed by Bransby Cooper (<i>Life</i>, vol. 1. p.
423), Naples thus describes himself: &#8220;Jos<sup>h</sup>. N&mdash;&mdash;<small><a name="f28.1" id="f28.1" href="#f28">[28]</a></small> &#8216;Resurgam Hommo,&#8217;
for trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>The writing and spelling in the Diary show him to have been a man of
superior education to most of his class. He continued in the
resurrectionist business up to the time of the passing of the Anatomy Act,
when he was taken on as a servant in the dissecting-room of St. Thomas&#8217;
Hospital.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>There is considerable difficulty in identifying many of the burial-grounds
from which bodies are said in the Diary to have been stolen. Many of these
were private, and the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> mentioned is probably either that of the
proprietor or of the care-taker. No doubt, too, some of the names are
slang terms which are quite forgotten at the present day.<small><a name="f29.1" id="f29.1" href="#f29">[29]</a></small></p>

<p><br />The debates in the Houses of Parliament on the Anatomy Bills will be found
in <i>Hansard</i>.</p>

<p>There is also much information in the pages of the <i>Lancet</i> for the period

took a great interest in the question, and wrote many vigorous articles,
pointing out defects in the Bills whilst they were under discussion.</p>

<p><a name="f26" id="f26" href="#f26.1">[26]</a> B. Cooper gives an account of a Resurrectionist under the name of
&#8220;Patrick&#8221;; this is probably the man referred to. The name is Harnell in
the <i>Sun</i> for October 14th, 1812; it may, perhaps, be a misprint for
Harnett; two men of this name have already been spoken of.</p>

<p><a name="f29" id="f29" href="#f29.1">[29]</a> Since the above was written, Mrs. Basil Holmes&#8217; interesting volume on
<i>The Burial Grounds of London</i> has been published. Reference to this book
confirms the statement above made. Mrs. Holmes&#8217; account is very carefully
done, and the list of the old burial-grounds is probably as complete as it
can be, but no light is thrown upon any of the difficult names used in the
Diary.</p>

approached through the present south transept. Holmes, <i>loc. cit.</i> It is

<p><a name="f70" id="f70" href="#f70.1">[70]</a> Millard was superintendent of the dissecting-room at St. Thomas&#8217;; he
was an avaricious man, and lost this situation through dealing in bodies.
His plan was to take them in at the hospital from the resurrection-men,
and then to sell them at an advanced price in Edinburgh unknown to the men
who supplied him, and to the teachers at the hospital. Millard was popular
with the pupils, and, after his dismissal, they persuaded him to take an
eating-house in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas&#8217;. As there was money to be
made in the &#8220;resurrection&#8221; traffic, he did not abandon his connection with
the body-snatchers. This came to be known, and created a strong prejudice
against him; so much so that his legitimate business fell off to such an
extent as to make it necessary for him to relinquish it altogether. Then
he took entirely to the resurrection business, and was sentenced to three
months&#8217; imprisonment for taking a body from the burial-ground attached to
the London Hospital. He appealed against the sentence, and found bail.
Then he brought an action against the magistrate at Lambeth for false
imprisonment; this was set aside, and Millard was sent back to Cold Bath
Fields to complete his sentence. He tried hard to get Sir Astley Cooper to
solicit a pardon for him, but without avail. This so preyed on his mind
that he threatened Sir Astley with bodily injury. Ultimately Millard quite
lost his reason, and died in gaol. In 1825 his widow published a pamphlet
entitled, &#8220;An Account of the circumstances attending the imprisonment and
death of the late William Millard, formerly superintendent of the Theatre
of Anatomy of St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital, Southwark.&#8221; The pamphlet states that
Millard had notice to leave St. Thomas&#8217; because it was found that he was
supplying Mr. Grainger with bodies, and that Sir Astley Cooper was
determined to put an end to the school which Grainger had established. The
publication is of a very abusive character; the surgeon of the gaol, Mr.
Wakley, of the <i>Lancet</i>, and the authorities at the hospital, all come in
for severe censure. The whole tone of the pamphlet is so exaggerated that
it is impossible to tell whether there is any truth in Mrs. Millard&#8217;s
grievances.</p>

trade; the object of following was to try and prevent his doing any
business. (See page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>.) The next entry shows that the Jew had sold a body
at St. Bartholomew&#8217;s; there was &#8220;a row&#8221; at this, and, no doubt, &#8220;the
regular men&#8221; had to be pacified.</p>

<p><a name="f78" id="f78" href="#f78.1">[78]</a> Placed there by friends of the deceased, in all probability.</p>
